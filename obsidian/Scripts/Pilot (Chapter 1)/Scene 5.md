***This is Alex's work routine from now on.***

***The following is just templates for the emails, since this minigame will be played every day in this game.***

TO BE ADDED

##### Alex Meets with Seraphina
---
**Alex:** *Okay. Time to meet with Seraphina in the laboratory.*

***Once he arrives...***

**Alex:** *Sera's already hard at work by the time I arrived at the laboratory. Not surprising. She's well-known for being a... well... workhorse. It's like her brain can focus for ridiculously long stretches of time. And the intensity is enough to chase everyone else home.*

**Alex:** *Should I get her attention? She seems pretty focused. Would she get annoyed?*

***Sera suddenly turns around.***

**Sera:** Good. You made it. I started a repeat of Dr. Chen's experiments this morning after the meeting so they're finished now.

**Alex:** What are the results?

**Sera:** As expected. That is to say - Dr. Chen wasn't lying. I didn't think he was, but I had to see it for myself. We need to find a way to reproduce the data. Any ideas on variables we could be overlooking?

**Alex:** The usual suspects don't show anything? Temperature?

**Sera:** No, I ran those experiments with Dr. Chen's because I had the same thought.

**Alex:** *What am I even doing here? Sera's a top-tier researcher - the best this lab has to offer. I don't even think she knows my name.*

**Sera:** I'm going to continue perusing the monitoring data from Dr. Chen's experiments. Maybe something will come up. Let me know if you get any ideas.

***At this point, Alex should look around the lab. Seraphina's and Dr. Chen's experiments notes should be on two separate tables. They should say the following:***

**Dr. Chen's Notes:** ...we are ready to run the experiments now. We've carefully accounted for numerous factors. Shielding will help prevent interference from external *magnetic fields.*

**Dr. Chen's Notes:** Our setup should also allow us to control, very precisely, *electric fields* which could cause strange things to happen.

**Dr. Chen's Notes:** We've checked the equipment, and the vacuum is running effectively - *vacuum quality* should be good.

**Sera's Notes:** Things to test. *Temperature* - it might have changed over the course of Dr. Chen's long experiment.

**Sera's Notes:** And maybe *humidity*? There was no mention of it in Dr. Chen's notes, so he may not have accounted for it.

***Then he can go back to Sera.***

**Sera:** So any ideas?

**Alex:** *Okay, what factors have Sera and Dr. Chen NOT accounted for?*

***Dialogue option 1***
	**Alex:** Temperature
***Dialogue option 2***
    **Alex:** Magnetic Fields
***Dialogue option 3***
	**Alex:** Electric Fields
***Dialogue option 4***
	**Alex:** Vibration/Sound
***Dialogue option 5***
	**Alex:** Vacuum Quality
***Dialogue option 6***
	**Alex:** Light
***Dialogue option 7***
	**Alex:** Humidity

***If Alex doesn't pick Vibration/Sound and Light:***
	**Sera:** We've already accounted for that.
***Otherwise:***
	**Sera:** Oh, good idea.

**Sera:** I'll set up the vibration and light values. Can you start the experiments over there?

***At this point, a sequenced recall minigame will play to start the experiments. Afterwards, the ending conversation.***

**Sera:** Alright. The experiments should be done by tomorrow. Anything else before we go?

**Alex:** *There was one factor I thought of, but... it would sound like I read too many science fiction books as a kid. Which I did. But -*

**Sera:** You look like you have something to say. What is it?

**Alex:** *Crap. She really holds nothing back.*

**Alex:** Well, I... um...

**Alex:** ...

**Alex:** *She's still waiting... Ugh... It's a stupid idea - can't she let it go?*

**Alex:** ...time.

**Alex:** *As the word processes in her mind, her eyebrows furrowed. I knew I shouldn't have said anything. Now you've done it, Alex. She's going to berate you on your stupidity...*

**Sera:** Time isn't really a variable we check.

**Alex:** *I know... But the idea just kinda... came up.*

**Sera:** But our field does have some crazy stuff in it. Maybe time is a variable we should be checking. There's no evidence that time *doesn't* play a factor. We'll try it if these experiments don't show what we're looking for.

**Alex:** *Wait... is she actually taking my idea seriously?*

**Alex:** *That's... new.*

##### Researcher Walks In
---
***At this point, a researcher walks in.***

**Researcher:** Ah, there's my bag -

**Researcher:** What are you two doing here so late?

**Alex:*** ...

**Sera:** We're trying to reproduce Dr. Chen's data.

**Researcher:** ...

**Researcher:** You know hundreds of man-hours have already gone into trying to reproduce that data, right?

**Sera:** Yes. I'm willing to add to that.

**Researcher:** You must really think you're some sort of hot shot, don't you?

**Alex:** *Sera's eyes narrowed. It doesn't take a genius to tell she's angry. But surprisingly, especially considering her reputation, she didn't reply.*

**Researcher:** I'll leave you two to waste time.

***And with that, the researcher leaves them alone.***

**Alex:** *Should I say something?*

***Dialogue option 1 - lower relationship with Sera a lot.***
	**Alex:** Do you? Do you think you're better than everyone?
	**Sera:** Do you? Are you here because you don't think everyone else did a good job trying to reproduce the data?
	**Result:** Sera hates that response.
***Dialogue option 2 - raises relationship with Sera a lot.***
	**Alex:** I'll be here tomorrow. With a Do Not Disturb sign. Are you okay?
	**Sera:** I'm fine. I'll see you tomorrow then.
	**Result:** Sera loves that response.
