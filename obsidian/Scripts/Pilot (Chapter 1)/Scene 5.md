##### Alex Meets with Seraphina
---
**Alex:** *Okay. Time to meet with Seraphina in the laboratory.*

***Once he arrives...***

**Alex:** *Sera's already hard at work by the time I arrived at the laboratory. Not surprising. She's well-known for being a... well... workhorse. It's like her brain can focus for ridiculously long stretches of time. And the intensity is enough to chase everyone else home.*

**Alex:** *Should I get her attention? She seems pretty focused. Would she get annoyed?*

***Sera suddenly turns around.***

**Sera:** Good. You made it. I started a repeat of Dr. Chen's experiments this morning after the meeting so they're finished now.

**Alex:** What are the results?

**Sera:** As expected. That is to say - Dr. Chen wasn't lying. I didn't think he was, but I had to see it for myself. We need to find a way to reproduce the data. Any ideas on variables we could be overlooking?

**Alex:** The usual suspects don't show anything? Temperature?

**Sera:** No, I ran those experiments with Dr. Chen's because I had the same thought.

**Alex:** *What am I even doing here? Sera's a top-tier researcher - the best this lab has to offer.*
