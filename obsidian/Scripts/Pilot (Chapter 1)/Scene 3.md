### Scene 3: At Home: Alex Reflects on Work
---
*Alex collapses into his desk chair. Minigame starts, and he talks to himself as the minigame continues.*

**Alex:** What am I doing with my life?

**Alex:** I never thought research would make me feel so dead inside.

**Alex:** I just want to discover things, freely uncovering the mysteries of the universe.

**Alex:** That rush of excitement when pursuing the truth down the path my curiosity takes me... when's the last time I felt that?

**Alex:** It feels like everyone I talk to... they lost all sense of curiosity and love of discovery.

**Alex:** Mark today was just one example. He didn't care about the truth - he just wanted to push his theory for some reason. Until Sera pointed out that his theory depended on hidden variables.

**Alex:** He knew she was right, but he couldn't bring himself to reject his theory. Why?

**Alex:** Who knows? Maybe he hoped it would make a name for himself, so he couldn't let go of the idea. Or maybe he just wanted to prove himself right. Whatever the reason, he had lost his curiosity for the truth.

**Alex:** ...

**Alex:** Maybe I was too idealistic.

**Alex:** ...

**Alex:** Man, this is depressing...

*Phone rings.*

**Alex:** Hey, mom.

**Alex's Mom:** Hey, Alex, how are you?

**Alex:** Fine. All fine.

**Alex's Mom:** Are you planning on ever visiting? Maybe for the holidays?

**Alex:** I told you, mom - I'm not planning on ever coming back.

**Alex's Mom:** It's been years -

**Alex:** Not long enough.

**Alex's Mom:** Well... just thought I'd ask.

**Alex:** *sigh* Hey, mom, I'm pretty tired. It's been a long day.

**Alex's Mom:** Okay. I'll let you go then.

**Alex:** Thanks. I'll send you this month's funds in a couple days.

**Alex's Mom:** Okay. Well... thank you. Goodnight, Alex.

**Alex:** Night, mom.

**Alex:** *What kind of son hasn't seen his mother in almost a decade?*
