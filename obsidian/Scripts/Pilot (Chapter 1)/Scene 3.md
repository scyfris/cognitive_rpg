##### Alex Reflecting on His Life - Science Notes Puzzle Minigame
---
***The scene opens with Alex at the doorway in his apartment. After a second, Alex walks over to his desk chair and sits down. He sighs before the minigame starts, and he talks to himself as the minigame continues. There's no failure, and this is needed to progress.***

***Directions.***
	**Alex:** I have some ideas I want to put together on paper. However, things are a little hazy in my brain.
	**Alex:** Drag the pieces to their silhouettes to solidify my thoughts on paper.

***After each puzzle completed, Alex will say each of the following in order:***

***First.***
	**Alex:** *I never thought research would make me feel so dead inside.*
	**Alex:** *That rush of excitement when pursuing down the path my curiosity takes me... when's the last time I felt that?*

***Second.***
	**Alex:** *It feels like everyone I talk to... they lost all sense of curiosity and love of discovery.*
	**Alex:** *Mark today was just one example.*
	**Alex:** *He knew Sera was right, but he couldn't bring himself to reject his theory.*

***Third.***
	**Alex:** *Maybe he hoped it would make a name for himself, so he couldn't let go of the idea. Or maybe he just wanted to prove himself right. Whatever the reason, he had lost his curiosity for the truth.*
	**Alex:** *Maybe I was too idealistic, becoming a researcher.*

***Fourth. (With time) Turn this into a speech game, where the patient would say the things on screen.***
	***Phone rings.***
	**Alex:** Hey, mom.
	**Alex's Mom:** Hey, Alex, how are you?
	**Alex:** Fine. All fine.
	**Alex's Mom:** Are you planning on ever visiting? Maybe for the holidays?
	**Alex:** I told you, mom - I'm not planning on ever coming back.
	**Alex's Mom:** It's been years -
	**Alex:** Not long enough.
	**Alex's Mom:** Well... just thought I'd ask.
	**Alex:** *sigh* Hey, mom, I'm pretty tired. It's been a long day.
	**Alex's Mom:** Okay. I'll let you go then.
	**Alex:** Thanks. I'll send you this month's funds in a couple days.
	**Alex's Mom:** Okay. Well... thank you. Goodnight, Alex.
	**Alex:** Night, mom.
	***Phone clicks closed.***

**Alex:** *What kind of son hasn't seen his mother in almost a decade?*

***Short flashback to a mental image of his dad.***
**Alex:** *Yeah... never going back.*

##### Dillon Shows Up
---
***Doorbell rings. Alex goes to answer it, and Dillon comes in with another machine in his arms.***

**Dillon:** What's up, man? How's it going?

**Alex:** What is that?

**Alex:** *This is Dillon. We've been friends since high school. More like brothers, actually. We went to the same... well... he's a mechanic, and I'm a researcher.*

**Alex:** *We're so close, he followed me all the way here to work. He has his own place, but he likes to come over to mine.*

**Dillon:** No hello? You wound me, Al.

**Alex:** You've turned my whole kitchen into a workshop! No more stuff!

**Alex:** *Dillon likes working on his own projects after work. But because he likes to come over to my place, he's decided that part of my space will be his work space. I always make a stink about it, but I don't really care.*

**Alex:** *I don't use the kitchen anyways.*

**Dillon:** Dude, you don't even use the kitchen.

**Alex:** *To be honest, I actually enjoy him working on his projects in my apartment. Makes the place feel less empty.*

**Alex:** *Sometimes, he'd teach me some stuff, and actually, making stuff - it isn't that bad. It makes me feel like I'm actually doing something if that makes sense. Instead of my work going into some black hole somewhere.*

**Alex:** *Maybe I should've become a mechanic instead of a researcher.*

**Alex:** *In any case, with my initial protests out of the way, we both settled into our routines. I figured I could look over Dr. Chen's data before the meeting tomorrow.*

##### Math Data Minigame
---
***Directions.***
	**Alex:** Let's focus in on the outlier data that Dr. Chen was referring to.
	**Alex:** Point out the numbers that don't match up.

***Failure - after a value.***
	**Alex:** Let's see... No, that value looks fine.

***Failure - after three wrong answers.***
	**Alex:** I think I need a break...

***Success.***
	**Alex:** I think that's it. Let's take a look and analyze the data.

**Alex:** What the - ?

**Alex:** *What is this? Dr. Chen's email specifically stated that the data shows outliers that appear unrelated to experimental factors. But the data here shows that the anomalies are occurring under specific experimental conditions involving extremely high-energy states.*

**Alex:** *Why did he reach such an obviously false conclusion?*

##### Conclusion
---
**Dillon:** What's wrong?

**Alex:** Oh... nothing. Just... work stuff.

**Dillon:** You know it's past work hours, right?

**Alex:** This is for the meeting tomorrow morning.

**Dillon:** Why bother? They don't ever listen to you anyway.

**Alex:** It's not their fault.

**Dillon:** It's not yours.

**Alex:** ...

**Dillon:** Although if you ask me, it is their fault. "That kid doesn't talk loudly or quickly enough! Their opinion must not be important!"

**Dillon:** Just because you don't shove your intelligence into people's faces doesn't mean you're stupid.

**Alex:** I know that.

**Dillon:** Right.
