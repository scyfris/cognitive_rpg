***After finishing work routine:***

**Sera:** It worked.

**Alex:** Really???

**Sera:** Yeah. It's reproducing consistently now. Exciting, isn't it?

**Alex:** I can't believe it.

**Sera:** I know. I'm going to send out an email to update the lab. After work, we can talk about next steps.

***Sera leaves.***

**Alex:** *It was hard concentrating the rest of the day because of the breakthrough. Eventually, I received the email update that Sera sent to the lab.*

**Alex:** *It wasn't long before trouble arrived - in the form of Dr. Chen's indignation. We could hear his voice down the hall.*

**Dr. Chen's Voice:** - this is my research!

**Alex:** *I'm pretty sure he's arguing with Sera, but I can't hear her responses because her volume doesn't go above 55 decibels. It sounds like they're in the lab.*

***Minigame to go to lab.***

##### Dr. Chen and Sera
---
**Sera:** - you knew I was looking into those anomalies. You even gave me your blessing -

**Dr. Chen:** Those anomalies were from machine malfunctions! You’ve wasted resources -

**Sera**: Except, it wasn’t a waste, was it? And those anomalies weren't from machine malfunctions. We’ve made a breakthrough.

**Dr. Chen**: You just got lucky. That also doesn’t change the fact that you disregarded my decisions -

**Sera**: I respected your decision for the project. But what I do in my spare time is my decision alone. Not to mention - again - that you expressed your consent at the meeting.

**Dr. Chen**: So you think you know better? It's about respect!

**Sera:** ...

**Dr. Chen:** That's the real problem here! You think you know better than the rest of us, so you go off trying to undermine us.

**Dr. Chen:** I'd be careful if I were you. Not everyone is willing to let themselves go the way of that research team you got fired.

**Sera:** I'm going home. You can decide what you want to do.

***Sera walks out, stopping by Alex.***

**Sera:** Dr. Wright. Sorry, we'll have to discuss things another time.

***Sera leaves.***

**Alex:** ...

**Alex:** *Is she... crying?*

##### Alex Follows Sera
---
**Alex:** *I should probably go home.*

**Alex:** *I need to grab my stuff from the office.*

***Minigame to go back to the office.***

**Alex:** *...maybe I should follow her just to make sure she's okay.*

**Alex:** *Although she's going home. Isn't that a bit creepy?*

**Alex:** *Hmm... well, I should at least make sure she's not going to walk into the middle of traffic or crash...*

***Black screen:***
	**Alex:** *I ended up walking around campus, asking people if they've seen her. Not weird or suspicious at all.*
	**Alex:** *But I found the info I needed in the end. Apparently, she was seen walking towards downtown.*
	**Alex:** *I don't go downtown much, but it was surprisingly easy to find her. Why? Because she was still wearing her lab coat and so she stood out like white on black.*
	**Alex:** *She was in the last place anyone would think to look for her.*
	**Alex:** *A bar. And not just any bar. A bar with loud music playing, smelling like beer... Not a place you go to unwind after work. A place you go to get drunk.*

**Alex:** Sera?

**Alex:** *Sera's head snapped up. Her eyes were dry. But she's already finishing her second glass of... something.*

**Sera:** Dr. Wright. Hey.

**Alex:** *Well, she doesn't sound drunk... yet. Her voice is just a bit slurred.*
