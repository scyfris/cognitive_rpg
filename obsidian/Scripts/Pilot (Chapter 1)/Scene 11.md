***After finishing work routine:***

**Sera:** It worked.

**Alex:** Really???

**Sera:** Yeah. It's reproducing consistently now. Exciting, isn't it?

**Alex:** I can't believe it.

**Sera:** I know. I'm going to send out an email to update the lab. After work, we can talk about next steps.

***Sera leaves.***

**Alex:** *It was hard concentrating the rest of the day because of the breakthrough. Eventually, I received the email update that Sera sent to the lab.*

**Alex:** *It wasn't long before trouble arrived - in the form of Dr. Chen's indignation. We could hear his voice down the hall.*

**Dr. Chen's Voice:** - this is my research!

**Alex:** *I'm pretty sure he's arguing with Sera, but I can't hear her responses because her volume doesn't go above 55 decibels. It sounds like they're in the lab.*

***Minigame to go to lab.***

##### Dr. Chen and Sera
---
**Sera:** - you knew I was looking into those anomalies. You even gave me your blessing -

**Dr. Chen:** Those anomalies were from machine malfunctions! You’ve wasted resources -

**Sera**: Except, it wasn’t a waste, was it? And those anomalies weren't from machine malfunctions. We’ve made a breakthrough.

**Dr. Chen**: You just got lucky. That also doesn’t change the fact that you disregarded my decisions -

**Sera**: I respected your decision for the project. But what I do in my spare time is my decision alone - the institute allows usage of equipment for personal experiments so long as it doesn't interfere with funded projects. Not to mention - again - that you expressed your consent at the meeting. The meeting notes are online -

**Dr. Chen**: So you think you know better? It's about respect!

**Sera:** ...

**Dr. Chen:** That's the real problem here! You think you know better than the rest of us, so you go off trying to undermine us.

**Dr. Chen:** I'd be careful if I were you. Not everyone is willing to let themselves go the way of that research team you got fired.

**Sera:** I'm going home. You can decide what you want to do.

***Sera walks out, stopping by Alex.***

**Sera:** Dr. Wright. Sorry, we'll have to discuss things another time.

***Sera leaves.***

**Alex:** ...

**Alex:** *Is she... crying?*

##### Alex Follows Sera
---
**Alex:** *I should probably go home.*

**Alex:** *I need to grab my stuff from the office.*

***Minigame to go back to the office.***

**Alex:** *...maybe I should follow her just to make sure she's okay.*

**Alex:** *Although she's going home. Isn't that a bit creepy?*

**Alex:** *Hmm... well, I should at least make sure she's not going to walk into the middle of traffic or crash...*

***Black screen:***
	**Alex:** *I ended up walking around campus, asking people if they've seen her. Not weird or suspicious at all.*
	**Alex:** *But I found the info I needed in the end. Apparently, she was seen walking towards downtown.*
	**Alex:** *I don't go downtown much, but it was surprisingly easy to find her. Why? Because she was still wearing her lab coat and so she stood out like white on black.*
	**Alex:** *She was in the last place anyone would think to look for her.*
	**Alex:** *A bar. And not just any bar. A bar with loud music playing, smelling like beer... Not a place you go to unwind after work. A place you go to get drunk.*
	**Alex:** *I hate this place. My instincts are screaming at me to run far away from this place.*
	**Alex:** *But when I saw her, I don't know... I couldn't leave her here. Alone.*

**Alex:** Sera?

**Alex:** *Sera's head snapped up. Her eyes were dry. But she's already finishing her second glass of... something.*

**Sera:** Dr. Wright. Hey.

**Alex:** *Well, she doesn't sound drunk... yet. Her voice is just a bit slurred. How much alcohol has she had already? It would be rather tactless to simply smell or taste her drinks...*

**Bartender:** Can I get you something?

**Alex:** *Never...*

**Alex:** *!*

**Alex:** *That's right. I can order the same.*

**Alex:** Can I get the same as hers?

**Bartender:** Coming right up.

**Alex:** Dr. Chen didn't sound too happy about being shown up.

**Sera:** No. No, he didn't.

**Alex:** *...*

**Alex:** *Well, this is awkward. What am I supposed to say to her?*

**Bartender:** Here you go.

**Alex:** Thanks.

**Alex:** *Ugh... She drank two of these?*

**Alex:** *I must have made a face because Sera is giving me a look.*

**Sera:** I don't take you for the drinking type.

**Alex:** I'm not. I don't drink. This is my first time at a bar.

**Alex:** *And I'd prefer it being my last.*

**Sera:** Seriously? And you ordered that? Do you even know what you ordered?

**Alex:** *Of course not. I only ordered it to guess your alcohol intake.*

**Sera:** Well... if you're not going to finish it, can I? I'll pay for it.

**Alex:** ...sure.

**Sera:** Thanks.

**Alex:** How can you drink that stuff?

**Sera:** The burn and taste take me out of my head. I need it after having to listen to Dr. Chen's rant. I hate working here.

**Alex:** *Why are you still here then? You're a great researcher. You can just leave and join up with another institute. One that will fit better your ideals and ambition.*

**Sera:** I'm only staying here because I want to figure out who it was who ratted that research team out and left me up to hang. Give them a piece of my mind. Or thank them. Or both. I don't know.

**Alex:** I don't take you for the type to care about what others think.

**Sera:** What? You think I'm a rock or something? Of course I'm affected by what others think. I just do things my way despite that because I know my stuff and I trust my instincts.

**Sera:** What's your problem anyway?

**Alex:** Sorry?

**Sera:** If you have something to say, just say it.

**Sera:** You have great ideas. Your intuition is better than most of the researchers at the lab. And you have a firm understanding of our field. But you don't say anything! Not unless I literally force it out of you.

**Alex:** ...

**Sera:** Whatever... I'm going home.

**Alex:** Wait -

***Sounds of banging before Sera's on the floor.***

**Sera:** ...fuck.

**Alex:** You're drunk. Let me call you a taxi. Where do you live?

**Sera:** I'm not taking a taxi. I live like two blocks away!

**Alex:** Okay. Well. Let me walk you home then.

***If relationship with Sera is positive:***
	**Sera:** At least take me out to dinner first.
***Otherwise:***
	**Sera:** Whatever.
