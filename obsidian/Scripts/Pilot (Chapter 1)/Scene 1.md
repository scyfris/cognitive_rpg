##### Introduction to Alex
---
***(Lack of time) Black screen with only text.
(With time) Shadowy, static-y, foreshadowing images.***

**Alex's Voice:** *When I was younger, I used to dream about being a scientist. Not in the realistic way, mind you. That's what happens when your head is always stuck in a science fiction novel. Besides, I was a child - how was I supposed to know what being a scientist is really like?*

*I imagined myself clad in a white lab coat, unlocking the secrets of the universe. My romantic fantasies stretched as far as my imagination would allow them, far away from the little house I grew up in.*

*But those were dreams, and eventually I woke up.*

***The screen blacks out for a moment.***

***Alarm sounds. A tapping sound like someone turning it off. A sigh. (With time) Alex wakes up in his apartment - radial blur of his view.***

**Alex:** *Coffee...*

***Pans out to isometric view of apartment. This is the tutorial scene, so some UI indicator should point out where the coffee machine is as well as to tap to move.***

##### If the player tries to click on computer w/o coffee
---
***(Lack of Time)***
***First click***
	**Alex:** *85% of adults in Freedonia need coffee to function on a daily basis.*
	**Alex:** *I'm not one of the other 15%.*
***Subsequent clicks***
	**Alex:** *Seriously, I need coffee.*

***(With time)***
***First click***
	**Alex:** ...
	***Minigame boots up, but letters are scrambled. Minigame closes.***
	**Alex:** *Yeah, no. I need coffee. I'm one of the 85% in Freedonia who needs it to function on a daily basis.*
***Subsequent clicks***
	**Alex:** *Seriously, I need coffee.*

##### Coffee Minigame
---
***First time playing.***
	**Alex:** Alright. Coffee. I do this every day, and sometimes I still forget the steps, being half-asleep as I usually am.
	**Alex**: Memorize the steps to make coffee *in order*.
	***Have the list glow.***
	**Alex**: After a while, the steps will disappear, and we'll be making coffee from memory. Tap the item corresponding to each step *in order*.
	***Have a little finger icon tap items in order.***
	**Alex:** And... that's it! Let's go!

***Subsequent times.***
	**Alex**: Alright, let's make coffee. Remember to memorize the steps *in order,* and then tap the item corresponding to each step *in order*.
	**Alex**: Let's go!

***Failure.***
**Alex:** Hmph. I was so sure that was correct.
**Alex**: Well. I have plenty of coffee to try again, so a failure isn't going to ruin my morning.

***Success.***
**Alex**: Ahh... wake up, and smell the coffee, Alex.

##### If the player tries to leave without coffee
---
***First click***
	**Alex:** *I walk to work. Without coffee, I might walk right into traffic without realizing it.*
	**Alex:** *I'd really rather be alive.*
***Subsequent click***
	**Alex:** *I'm not suicidal.*

##### After Alex makes coffee
---
**Alex:** *And I'm alive again. I should probably answer some emails before going to work.*

**Alex:** *Technically, I'm procrastinating. But I mean... it's not as though the lab needs me...*

##### Email Minigame
---
***First time playing.***
	**Alex**: Next in my morning routine is emails. I can be pretty forgetful, so I like to write things down for later.
	**Alex**: Go through the emails here - 
	***Make email panel glow.***
	**Alex**: - and then answer questions about the emails here.
	***Make the question and answer panel glow.***
	**Alex**: And that's it. Let's get to work.

***Subsequent times.***
	**Alex**: Remember - go through the emails and then answer questions about them.
	**Alex**: Let's get to work.

***Failure.***
**Alex**: Hmm... That doesn't feel right.
**Alex**: I should probably double-check.

***Success.***
**Alex**: Awesome. One email down.

##### If the player tries to leave without answering emails
---
**Alex:** *I would like to prolong going to work as long as possible.*

##### Emails
---
***These are the emails in the minigame, which will load up when the player taps on Alex's computer.***

**Email:** 

**Subject: MARK YOUR CALENDARS - Quantum Computing Seminar on May 20**

We are excited to announce an upcoming seminar on the latest advancements in quantum computing. Dr. Rodriguez from the Quantum Information Science group will be presenting on May 20 at 11am. Please mark your calendars, and we encourage everyone interested in this cutting-edge field to attend.

**Alex:** *I should probably put that down. Sounds interesting.*

***After he notes that on his calendar, next email.***

**Email:** 

**Subject: Safety Training**

As part of our ongoing commitment to safety, we remind all members that the annual safety training is due by May 15. Please complete the online modules and attend the scheduled hands-on sessions on May 12 and May 13 to ensure a safe working environment for all. Your cooperation is crucial for the well-being of our community.

**Alex:** *Not this again. Have they never heard of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle? "The more you know about safety, the less certain you are about getting through the day without accident."*

**Alex:** *I should probably note that down though.*

***After he notes that on his calendar, next email.***

**Email:** 

**Subject: Re: Update: Quantum Entanglement Experiment Progress**

Hi Team,

I noticed unexpected surges in quantum entanglement patterns that appear unrelated to external factors. However, I suspect it might be due to our environmental monitoring and experimental setup. Let's discuss this at our next meeting.

Best,
Mike

**Alex:** *Dr. Chen's our research lead for this project. Unexpected surges unrelated to external factors are pretty much always due to mistakes in environmental monitoring or experimental setup. The meeting's tomorrow, so I'll need to take a look at the data tonight if I am to contribute anything meaningful...*

**Alex:** *...*

**Alex:** *Anyway, next email.*

**Email:** 

**Subject: Take a look at this artifact**

Dear Alex,

I know this is probably coming out of nowhere, but I'm an archaeologist from Petraitis University and I would like to show you an artifact for you to take a look at.

Best,
Dr. Vytautas Kazlauskas

**Alex:** *...that's not sketchy at all. I thought IT filters out spam mail. I guess some still make it through.*

**Alex:** *Well, that's it. Time to get to the lab.*

##### Getting Ready Minigame
---
***First time playing.***
	**Alex**: Let's make sure I have everything I need for work.
	**Alex**: Take note of the stuff I need - 
	***Make the list glow.***
	**Alex**: - and then when the list disappears, grab the items from the list.
	***Have a finger icon tap on the items from the list.***
	**Alex:** And... that's it! Let's go!

***Subsequent times.***
	**Alex**: Alright, let's grab my stuff. Remember to memorize the items on the list, and then tap on the items to grab them.

***Failure.***
**Alex**: I don't think I'm bringing the right stuff.
**Alex**: I don't want to rush back here after leaving, so might we try again?

***Success.***
**Alex**: Okay, I'm ready. Time to face the day.

##### Object References
---
***Fridge.***
**Alex:** *It's mostly empty except for soda cans and eggs. Sometimes Dillon's takeout if he's tired of my ramen cups.*

***Stove.***
**Alex:** *I don't mess with that. That's what ramen cups and pizza delivery are for.*

***Sink Area.***
**Alex:** *The plate's decor. Neither me nor Dillon uses it because then we'd have to wash it.*

***Kitchen Window with Plant.***
**Alex:** *I read that plants make one's home homier.*

***Cupboard.***
**Alex:** *Filled with ramen cups and disposable chopsticks. A feast fit for a king.*

***Futon.***
**Alex:** *I sleep fine on a futon.*

***Couch.***
**Alex:** *I hope I never have to move that thing again. I'm not that fit to begin with.*

***Coffee Maker.***
**Alex:** *It's in the perfect position between where I sleep and where I work. I roll out of bed, get coffee, and then roll into work.*
**Alex:** *It also makes hot water for my cup noodles, so I don't need to bother with a microwave or kettle.*

***Desk.***
**Alex:** *My workspace. To be honest, I prefer working at home rather than in the lab. Fewer interactions with colleagues that way...*

***Chair.***
**Alex:** *Hanging up my clothes every time I change is a pretty tall order.*

***Framed Paper Above Desk.***
**Alex:** *The paper on the discovery of the Higgs Boson.*

***Whiteboard.***
**Alex:** *A standard whiteboard. I don't actually use it for work that much. Mostly it's for Dillon whenever he feels like explaining some engineering concept to me. A physicist I may be, but an engineer I am most definitely not.*
**Alex:** *...*
**Alex:** *Sometimes I wonder though if maybe I should have gone into engineering.*

***Clock.***
**Alex:** *I don't know what to say. I mean... it's a clock.*

***Wastebasket.***
**Alex:** *I would take it out much more often if the dumpster isn't so far away. Besides, it's just paper trash. Nothing gross.*

***Stacks of Books.***
**Alex:** *I should probably get a bookshelf...*

***Big Box.***
**Alex:** *Dillon does this a lot. Buys something. Orders it to my place. Maybe opens it. And then it's here for the foreseeable future. Top-notch friend.*

***Laser Cutter.***
**Alex:** *Dillon's laser cutter.*

***3D Printer.***
**Alex:** *Dillon's 3D printer.*

***Dillon's Area.***
**Alex:** *Dillon's workspace. I don't know half of what that stuff is. Boxes of who-knows-what... Laptop... Chair... Uh... Oscilloscope? Yeah, oscilloscope... And a bunch of wires and other junk.*
