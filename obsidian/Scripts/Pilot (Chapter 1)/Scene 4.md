Dillon Comes Over
---
*There was a couple knocks on Alex's door before Dillon enters with a bunch of equipment in his arms.*

**Dillon:** What's up, man? How's it going?

**Alex:** What's that?

**Alex:** *This is Dillon. We've been friends since high school. More like brothers, actually. We went to the same... well... he's a mechanic, and I'm a researcher.*

**Alex:** *We're so close, he followed me all the way here to work.*

**Alex:** *He has his own place, but he likes to come over to mine.*

**Dillon:** No hello? You wound me, Al.

**Alex:** You've turned my whole kitchen area into a workshop! No more stuff!

**Alex:** *Dillon likes working on his own projects after work. But because he likes to come over to my place, he's decided that part of my space will be his work space. I always make a stink about it, but I don't really care.*

**Alex:** *I don't use the kitchen anyways.*

**Dillon:** Dude, you don't even use the kitchen.

**Alex:** So what are you making this time?

**Alex:** *To be honest, I actually enjoy him working on his projects in my apartment. Makes the place feel less empty.*

**Alex:** *Sometimes, he'd teach me some stuff, and actually, making stuff - it isn't that bad. It makes me feel like I'm actually doing something if that makes sense. Instead of my work going into some black hole somewhere.*

**Alex:** *Maybe I should've become a mechanic instead of a researcher.*

**Dillon:** Eh. I don't know. Maybe an electric skateboard or something.

**Alex:** Cool.

**Alex:** *And with that, we both settled into our routines. I figured I could look over Dr. Chen's data before the meeting tomorrow.*

*Math Minigame starts.*

**Alex:** What the - ?

**Alex:** *What is this? Dr. Chen's email specifically stated that the data shows fluctuations that appear unrelated to external factors. But the data here shows that the anomalies are occurring under specific experimental conditions involving extremely high-energy states.*

**Alex:** *Why did he reach such an obviously false conclusion?*

**Dillon:** What's wrong?

**Alex:** Oh... nothing. Just... work stuff.

**Dillon:** You know it's past work hours, right?

**Alex:** This is for the meeting tomorrow morning.

**Dillon:** Why bother? They don't ever listen to you anyway.
