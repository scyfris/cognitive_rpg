##### Meeting with Dr. Chen
---
***Scene with all the researchers sitting around a table in the meeting room with Dr. Chen at the head. Notably, Alex and Sera are there. However, while Alex is seated, Sera stands by the door.***

**Alex:** *While Dr. Chen spoke, I was restless. I don't know how to bring up what I found yesterday. I don't want to -*

**Alex:** *No! Alex, you have to! This is important! As a researcher, he'll appreciate it!*

**Dr. Chen:** So... any ideas as to why the data is so off?

**Alex:** I really... I mean...

**Wei:** Maybe the equipment overheated or something.

**Researcher 1:** So we should probably send the technician in or something. Make sure things are functional now.

**Alex:** *No! The equipment did not overheat! That's the reason we did A/B testing with different B values at random times in no particular order! We designed the experiment to account for that!*

**Alex:** Um, I... I don't think...

**Researcher 2:** John's not in until this afternoon, but he can take a look -

**Sera:** You look like you have something to say. What do you think?

**Alex:** *...crap. Sera's looking straight at me. And of course, she just brought everyone's attention to me. Why did she have to do that?*

**Sera:** Well?

**Wei:** What is your problem? Do you have to - ?

**Sera:** Let him talk. He's been trying to get all of your attention for a while.

***Silence.***

**Alex:** I don't think... The data doesn't look like equipment malfunction... We accounted for that in the experimental design...

**Alex:** *Suddenly, Dr. Chen looked rather uncomfortable. However... Sera... is she smiling? I don't think I've ever seen her smile in my time here. I must be imagining it because when I blinked, her intense expression was back on her face as she turned to Dr. Chen.*

**Sera:** I agree with that. Equipment malfunction wouldn't have given us that data. There are very specific cases where the numbers spiked.

**Dr. Chen:** ...that may seem to be the case -

**Sera:** The data's right in front of you. That *is* the case.

**Dr. Chen:** But we cannot publish this data! The conclusion drawn - it's too far-fetched!

**Alex:** *It looks like Dr. Chen and Sera are about to go into a full-blown shouting match. Well... mostly Dr. Chen is shouting. Sera... doesn't really shout. In fact, now that I think about it, her voice is softer than her personality.*

**Sera:** But it's consistent with the data. This is a breakthrough. Why won't you publish instead of trying to find some ridiculous excuse for the data not being right?

**Dr. Chen:** Because we can't reproduce the data! We've run the experiment multiple times over, and we can't get the data to reproduce! If we publish this data with such far-fetched implications, and other researchers can't reproduce the data, our reputation's ruined.

**Dr. Chen:** This is a one-off. Nothing more.

**Sera:** You seriously believe that? With all this data in front of you?

**Dr. Chen:** You can go down that hole if you like. I won't waste more time with it. We're done here. I'll contact John this afternoon.

***Cut scene of everyone getting up and leaving only Alex and Sera in the meeting room.***

**Alex:** *I should probably get back to work...*

***Player should tap on the door to get Alex to leave. However, just as he gets close to the door, another cut scene plays as Sera speaks to him.***

**Sera:** I'm going to figure this out. You're welcome to join me in this endeavor.

***Dialogue option 1 - lower relationship with Sera a lot.***
	**Alex:** Isn't it Dr. Chen's research? Wouldn't he know it best? Maybe let it go?
	**Sera:** You heard him. Even he doesn't think this is a one-off. But he's not willing to dig further. I am. I trust my instincts.
	**Result:** Sera hates that response.
***Dialogue option 2 - lower relationship with Sera slightly.***
	**Alex:** Maybe it's a one-off, like Dr. Chen said. Maybe let it go?
	**Sera:** Is that really what you think? You can let it go if you like. But I trust my instincts.
	**Result:** Sera dislikes that response.
***Dialogue option 3 - raises relationship with Sera slightly.***
	**Alex:** There might be something there. What do you plan to do?
	**Sera:** Run experiments until I can reproduce the data of course.
	**Result:** Sera likes that response.
***Dialogue option 4 - raises relationship with Sera a lot.***
	**Alex:** You're going to? And you're asking me? I'd love to!
	**Sera:** Like I said, you're welcome to join.
	**Result:** Sera loves that response.

**Sera:** If you're interested in joining me, feel free to find me after work.

***Sera walks out of the meeting room.***
