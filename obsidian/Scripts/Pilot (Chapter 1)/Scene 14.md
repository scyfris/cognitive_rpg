##### Talking to Dillon about Time Travel
---
***Alex comes home to see Dillon already there.***

**Alex:** Off work early?

**Dillon:** Yep. Off work on time?

**Alex:** Nope. I have a research proposal to write.

**Alex:** Dillon, something crazy happened today.

**Alex:** I convinced Sera to build a time machine.

**Dillon:** A... what? A time machine? Like from your sci-fi books?

**Alex:** Yes.

**Dillon:** Dude, I knew you had a crazy wild side, but this is something else.

**Dillon:** I want in.

**Alex:** Of course you would.

**Dillon:** Besides, you need me. You don't even know how to wire up a circuit -

**Alex:** I do - you taught me!

**Dillon:** - how do you expect to build anything?

**Alex:** Whatever.

**Alex:** I'm going to work on the proposal now.

***Cue linguistics minigame.***

##### Sera Comes Over
---
***Knocks can be heard. Alex gets up to answer.***

**Alex:** Who could be coming over at this hour?

***Sera walks in.***

**Alex:** Sera?

**Sera:** Hey. Mind if I stay here for a bit?

**Alex:** Uh, sure. You're always welcomed.

**Sera:** Thanks. You're working on the proposal?

**Alex:** Yeah.

***Sera sits on the couch and Alex returns to his desk.***

***Cue linguistics minigame.***

##### The Team's Response
---
**Sera:** As expected, they reacted pretty badly to it.

**Alex:** ...

**Sera:** I don't understand.

***Flashback to Alex's father.***

**Alex:** *Human behavior... Predictable, but incomprehensible.*

**Sera:** I'm trying so hard to be good... Why do they hate me so much?

***Another flashback to Alex's father.***

**Alex:** *People can be cruel. In this case, the reason is obvious. Sera knows this.*

***Flashback to a young Alex.***

**Alex:** *Her question isn't a question. It's a cry of despair and desperation.*

**Sera:** Hey.

**Alex:** Yeah?

**Sera:** Last night, what you said to me... Thank you.

**Alex:** It's no problem.

**Sera:** I feel like my entire life is a battle, from my parents to my work. So a resting spot is appreciated.

**Alex:** Your parents - like when you caused their legislation to fail?

**Sera:** That's only part of it. My parents aren't my real parents. My real parents died in the Crimson War when I was really young. I don't even remember them really.

**Sera:** My current parents, as you already know, were politicians. They adopted me... because it would make a great story on the news. "Senator So-and-So Adopted a War Orphan."

**Sera:** I was fifteen.

**Alex:** *Fifteen??? That's a really long time to be spending in an orphanage.*

**Sera:** I tried so hard to get myself adopted. The children I befriended one by one got adopted. Until it was just me. And as I got older, the chances of my adoption grew slimmer.

**Sera:** When my parents adopted me, I had all but given up hope. I thought I was unwanted, unlovable for reasons I don't even know. So when they adopted me, I fought hard for their approval, to show them that their choice wasn't a mistake, that they wouldn't regret taking me in

**Alex:** Hey, when the time machine's built and verified to work, I call dibs on the first thing we do with it.

**Alex:** We go back to when the press printed that story about you and the research team. And we find out who the researcher was who leaked the data. You can finally give them a piece of your mind and then leave this facility in peace.

**Sera:** Of all things, why that?

**Alex:** That's the only thing keeping you trapped here, right?

**Sera:** Well... yes...

**Alex:** Then it's settled.
