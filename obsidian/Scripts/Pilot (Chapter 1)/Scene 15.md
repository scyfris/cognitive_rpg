##### Confrontation with Wei
---
***Before Alex starts work.***

**Wei:** Alex.

**Alex:** Yeah?

**Wei:** Am I hearing right? You and Sera are going to... build a time machine?

**Alex:** Yeah. Assuming the proposal gets approval.

**Wei:** I see.

**Alex:** *Wei's giving me a look. A look of disbelief. I guess it's warranted... A time machine exists only in science fiction. Supposedly. A serious scientist taking on this endeavor risks his reputation if it doesn't go well.*

**Alex:** *And I guess it doesn't help that I'm part of it. I don't usually... rock the boat much. Most of my research is pretty tame. I don't have a lot of backbone when someone talks me down from something...*

**Alex:** *So it makes sense that Wei thinks I don't seem like the type of person to get into this type of project...*

**Alex:** *He doesn't know me.*
