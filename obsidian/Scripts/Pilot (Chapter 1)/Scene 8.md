##### Sera Notices Alex's Notebook
---
***After work, Sera and Alex are sitting in the lab, working on analyzing the data received from the experiments that day. The table is strewn with notebooks and papers. Sera is going between them all at a fast pace. Alex is fidgeting.***

**Alex:** *What do I do? Should I confront her about it?*

**Alex:** ...

**Alex:** *Yeah, right. When have I ever confronted anyone about anything? Besides, she might get angry and -*

***Suddenly, Sera grabbed a notebook between her and Alex. Alex doesn't notice.***

**Alex:** *That would make working with her really hard. Which normally isn't a problem since she and I don't really work on the same projects together.*

**Sera:** ...

**Alex:** *But I actually am pretty interested in this...*

**Sera:** ...

**Alex:** *But maybe I should stop this anyway... What if she -*

**Sera:** Dr. Wright.

**Alex:** *I mean... I don't want to lose my job... I have to support my mom too -*

**Sera:** Dr. Wright!

**Alex:** *Who is she - oh... Dr. Wright is me. No one ever calls me that though. To be honest, here, no one calls anyone by their title. Unless it's been ingrained into you.*

**Alex:** *Like Dr. Chen. Everyone just knows him as Dr. Chen. It's just weird calling him Mike.*

**Alex:** *But no one calls me Dr. Wright. Hearing it is so strange. I guess she knows my name after all.*

**Alex:** Pardon?

**Alex:** !!!

**Alex:** *Is she holding my - ?*

**Sera:** Here. Sorry for grabbing it. I was trying to grab my notebook but accidentally picked up yours.

**Alex:** *...what was she trying to do?*

**Sera:** ...

**Sera:** I didn't realize I picked up the wrong notebook until I opened it.

***Dialogue option 1 - lower relationship with Sera a lot.***
	**Alex:** What were you trying to do???
	**Sera:** Calm down... It was an accident...
	**Result:** Sera hates that response.
***Dialogue option 2 - lower relationship with Sera a lot.***
	**Alex:** Was it really an accident?
	**Sera:** What is that supposed to mean?
	**Result:** Sera hates that response.
***Dialogue option 3 - raises relationship with Sera slightly.***
	**Alex:** Accidents happen.
	**Sera:** Sorry. I'll be more careful next time.
	**Result:** Sera likes that response.

**Sera:** Your ideas. They're really good. I'm surprised I haven't heard them through the grapevine.

**Alex:** I don't really... These are just... late night ramblings...

**Sera:** Late night ramblings can have merit.

**Alex:** *...she really doesn't seem like someone who would get her entire research team fired for essentially a nonexistent cause.*

**Sera:** Anyway, I've analyzed the data from the experiments run. And it doesn't look like vibration, sound, or light variables reproduce those data points. Which means we can try your idea - time. 

**Sera:** We need to carefully design this though. Particles have no understanding of "9pm". So we need to figure out how to test time as a variable here.
