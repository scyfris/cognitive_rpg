##### Sera Notices Alex's Notebook
---
***After work, Sera and Alex are sitting in the lab, working on analyzing the data received from the experiments that day. The table is strewn with notebooks and papers. Sera is going between them all at a fast pace. Alex is fidgeting.***

**Alex:** *What do I do? Should I confront her about it?*

**Alex:** *Yeah, right. When have I ever confronted anyone about anything? Besides, she might get angry and -*

***Suddenly, Sera grabbed a notebook between her and Alex. Alex doesn't notice.***

**Alex:** *That would make working with her really hard. Which normally isn't a problem since she and I don't really work on the same projects together.*

**Sera:** ...

**Alex:** *But I actually am pretty interested in this...*

**Sera:** ...

**Alex:** *But maybe I should stop this anyway... What if she -*

**Sera:** Dr. Wright.

**Alex:** *I mean... I don't want to lose my job... I have to support my mom too -*

**Sera:** Dr. Wright!

**Alex:** *Who is she - oh... Dr. Wright is me. No one ever calls me that though. To be honest, here, no one calls anyone by their title. Unless it's been ingrained into you.*

**Alex:** *Like Dr. Chen. Everyone just knows him as Dr. Chen. It's just weird calling him Mike.*

**Alex:** *But no one calls me Dr. Wright. Hearing it is so strange. I guess she knows my name after all.*

**Alex:** Pardon?

**Alex:** !!!

**Alex:** *Is she holding my - ?*

**Sera:** Here. Sorry for grabbing it. I was trying to grab my notebook but accidentally picked up yours. I didn't realize I picked up the wrong notebook until I opened it.

***Dialogue option 1 - lower relationship with Sera a lot.***
	**Alex:** Was it really an accident?
	**Sera:** What is that supposed to mean?
	**Result:** Sera hates that response.
***Dialogue option 2 - raises relationship with Sera slightly.***
	**Alex:** It's fine... Accidents happen.
	**Sera:** Sorry. I'll be more careful next time.
	**Result:** Sera likes that response.

**Sera:** Your ideas. They're really good. I'm surprised I haven't heard them through the grapevine.

**Alex:** I don't really... These are just... late night ramblings...

**Sera:** Late night ramblings can have merit.

**Alex:** *Did she really get her entire research team fired for essentially a nonexistent cause?*

**Sera:** Anyway, I've analyzed the data from the experiments run. You should take a look as well to make sure our conclusions line up.

***Cue Math minigame.***

**Alex:** It doesn't look like vibration, sound, or light variables reproduce those data points.

**Sera:** Which means we can try your idea - time. 

**Sera:** We need to carefully design this though. Particles have no understanding of "9pm". So we need to figure out how to test time as a variable here.

***Pause for a few seconds.***

**Sera:** What's wrong?

***Dialogue option 1 - lower relationship with Sera a lot.***
	**Alex:** Why did you get that research team fired?
	**Sera:** ...well, I...
	**Sera:** You already think I'm guilty. You can believe what you want. I don't owe you anything. 
	**Result:** Sera hates that response.
***Dialogue option 2 - no changes.***
	**Alex:** I heard the story from Wei. You know. From last year, when you -
	**Sera:** - got an entire research team fired for fabricating data on a paper they didn't even publish?
	**Sera:** I'd rather not talk about that.

**Alex:** We're working together. And this is relevant.

**Sera:** ...

**Sera:** I didn't get them fired.

**Sera:** I was on the team for a while, and we were having trouble producing any groundbreaking results.

**Sera:** Feeling pressured, they finally decided to fabricate the data, knowing that very rarely does published data get validated - researchers want to spend their time exploring their own ideas, not verifying others' findings.

**Sera:** I didn't want to do that, and I threatened to publish a dissenting paper with the real data if they published - which would've ruined their careers.

**Sera:** They were shocked I had the guts. Especially since I was a relatively new researcher, and they were all my seniors.

**Sera:** If they only knew my parents and our history...

**Sera:** Anyway, they ended up not publishing. But they still kicked me off the team on the premise that I was causing too much drama. Which... isn't too hard to believe.

**Sera:** However... I'm not sure how, but the fabricated data, along with my own data, was leaked. And the press loved the drama. And well... the rest is history.

**Sera:** They were angry, thinking that I ratted them out anyway, so they told everyone the fabricated data was an accident from an equipment malfunction, and that they had been planning to verify the data. That I had tried to defame them.

**Alex:** But they were fired?

**Sera:** I had the press on my side. For once, the press actually reported the truth. But our colleagues... no one actually thought they were guilty.

**Sera:** The press reported that a researcher gave them this story. A researcher from the institution. The press *says* the researcher isn't me.

**Alex:** Everyone thought it was you. 

**Sera:** It wasn't.

**Alex:** *So that's what happened... But why didn't she push back against their story? Did she think it was a hopeless battle? That no one would believe her?*

**Alex:** *To be honest, her story isn't that believable... I mean, the paper was never published, and no one else at this institute - including this unnamed researcher - has said anything to confirm or deny Sera's innocence.*

***Flashback of Sera's silence the day before.***

**Alex:** *But strangely... I believe her.*

**Alex:** Hey, are you busy this weekend?

**Sera:** What?

**Alex:** My friend Dillon is hosting... well, he's forcing me to host a friendly video game tournament at my apartment every Saturday.

**Alex:** Uh, you're welcome to join.

**Sera:** ...

**Alex:** But not obligated to!

**Sera:** What games?

***The scene fades to black.***

**Alex's Voice:** In the end, Sera accepted the invitation.
