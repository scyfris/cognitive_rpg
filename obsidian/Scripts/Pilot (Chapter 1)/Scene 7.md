##### Wei's Warning
---
***After Alex's morning routine and he gets settled at his desk in the office, Wei approaches him.***

**Wei:** Is it true, Alex? You're working with Sera? Trying to reproduce the data from Dr. Chen's experiments?

**Alex:** *How do I reply to that? He obviously already knows. So why is he asking? What answer is he looking for?*

**Alex:** ...

**Wei:** ...

**Wei:** Alex, be careful.

**Alex:** Why?

**Wei:** Sera's a highly ambitious researcher. And she's not afraid to be cutthroat if she thinks it would help her make a name for herself.

**Alex:** *What does that mean? What does this have to do with reproducing Dr. Chen's data?*

**Wei:** You remember what happened last year just before you joined us? How she got an entire research team fired?

**Alex:** Yes...

**Wei:** She used to be part of that research team. But then they kicked her off because she caused too much drama on the team. You know how she is.

**Wei:** To save face, she analyzed their data and latched onto a few datapoints that were accidentally included from a machine malfunction. And then accused the team of data fabrication.

**Wei:** The thing is... that data? It wasn't even published. The research team never published it. It was just something they had on draft. And they were fired over it.

**Wei:** I'd be careful if I were you. If this project of yours doesn't go according to plan, she might ruin your reputation too.

##### Validating Wei's Claims
---
**Alex:** *Could it be that Wei's right? Did Sera really get a whole research team fired based on data they hadn't even published?*

**Alex:** *I should validate his claims... I can go into the institute archives, which have every paper published from the institute. And search for any papers written by that research team including the fabricated data.*

***Cue sequenced recall minigame.***

**Alex:** ...

**Alex:** Wei was right. The research team never published the data. And looking at the corresponding news articles, the articles never referenced a published paper either.

**Alex:** I should probably get the rest of my work done...

***Cue rest of minigames.***
