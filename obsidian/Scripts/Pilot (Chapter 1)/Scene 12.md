##### Settling Sera Down

***Black Screen.***

**Alex's Voice:** *Getting to her apartment was simple enough. She wasn't loud or... unwieldy, just an occasional trip. Glad she's not like... **him.***

**Alex's Voice:** *However, inside her apartment was a different story. We may as well never have left the bar.*

**Alex's Voice:** *I really don't want to be here.*

***Scene opens on Sera's apartment. Her roommate is having a party - and there's a lot of alcohol.***

**Remy:** Sera! Are you guys joining us?

**Alex:** Where's her room?

**Alex:** *I was going to just let her roommate take it from here, but...*

**Remy:** Oh, don't worry! If she was able to make it back home with a bit of help, she's fine! She's been through worse.

**Alex:** I -

**Sera:** Down the hall at the end.

***Cut scene where Alex drops Sera down on her bed. Her room should be a lot quieter than outside.***

**Sera:** Sorry for this... You can leave if you want.

**Alex:** Are you going to be okay?

**Sera:** I've been through worse.

**Sera:** Thanks. For caring.

**Alex:** Do you want me to leave?

**Sera:** Not really.

**Alex:** I'll be here then.

***Alex sits down on Sera's chair.***

**Alex:** *I get the feeling this might be a while. I probably should get some shut eye. Neither of us got any sleep last night, and after all this, I'm exhausted.*

***Cue puzzle game - Alex's dreams.***

##### Sera Talks
---
***Blinking screen to signal Alex waking up.***

**Alex:** *How long have I been out? Where am I? My back aches like -*

**Sera:** That looks very uncomfortable.

**Alex:** *Oh, right.*

**Alex:** It is a little.

**Sera:** It's nearly 10pm, in case you're wondering.

**Alex:** Thanks. 

**Alex:** Um, how are you feeling?

**Sera:** My head hurts. But nothing water and meds can't solve.

**Sera:** Sorry you had to see me like that.

**Alex:** *I don't know why exactly, but for the first time in a long time, I felt anger. White, hot anger.*

**Alex:** Dr. Chen shouldn't have talked to you like that.

**Sera:** ...I know.

**Alex:** Then why didn't you say anything??? I know you're not what he's accusing you of, so why didn't you say anything?

**Alex:** *I should calm down. She's not the person I'm angry at.*

***Silence.***

**Sera:** Because it's a slippery slope.

**Alex:** *What is she talking about?*

**Sera:** Nevermind.

**Sera:** I'm fine now and sober. I'll see you tomorrow at work?

**Alex:** *No! It can't keep going on like this. This... this... feels like harassment...*

***Flashback of Alex's dad slapping him.***

**Alex:** *Sera's done nothing wrong... She pursued her hunches... She was transparent with everyone...*

**Alex:** ...hey.

**Sera:** What?

**Alex:** If you need a place... you know, to get away from everything... my door's always open.

**Alex:** *You don't have to go to the bar to drink your emotions away. Or go home to uncaring roommates...*

**Sera:** ...

**Sera:** I'll think about it.
