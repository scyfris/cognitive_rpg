##### Testing Time as a Variable
---
**Alex's Voice:** For the first time in a long time, I actually kinda looked forward to work on Monday.

***After Alex gets ready and settles in at work:***

**Sera:** Dr. Wright.

**Alex:** Oh, hi.

**Sera:** We need to figure out how to test your theory that time might play a role in producing that data.

**Alex:** Maybe we can just start out with running the experiments at the original time Dr. Chen ran his?

**Alex:** *Okay, that is definitely a frown...*

**Sera:** Particles have no concept of abstract human constructs like 1pm. Those things are for our convenience - they have nothing to do with physical phenomenon.

**Alex:** I know... I just...

**Alex:** ...

**Sera:** He originally ran the experiments at 11:51am on Monday two weeks ago. I'll go set it up really quick.

***She exits.***

**Alex:** *Did she just - ?*

##### After Work
---
***As the last minigame finishes, the screen blacks out, and a loud thud could be heard.***

**Alex:** Ahh! What was that for???

**Sera:** It worked.

**Alex:** The data reproduced?

**Sera:** Yeah.

**Sera:** But I don't understand... there's nothing special about 11:51am on Mondays...

**Alex:** *I couldn't help it. I started laughing. She looked so confused.*

**Alex:** I didn't think there was. I still don't think there is. But there might be something going on at this time that might be causing the surges.

**Sera:** Oh. I see.

**Sera:** Why didn't you just say so?

**Alex:** ...

**Sera:** I don't understand. You have great ideas - why do you keep them to yourself?

**Alex:** *She makes it sound as though she's not the only one interested in what I think.*

**Sera:** ...

**Sera:** Okay. Well. Let's look through the lab logs to see what's been going on at 11:51am Mondays.

##### In the Lab - Setting Up - Sequenced Recall Minigame
---
**Sera:** It looks like both times, there were other experiments going on in parallel in the lab using independent setups. Specifically two experiments. The teams running them have been making it routine to run them on Mondays around this time.

**Sera:** To make sure these two experiments are causing the surges in Dr. Chen's experiments, we'll need to set them up and then run all three experiments in parallel.

**Sera:** It's really interesting, because no one would think these experiments could influence each other. They were run in isolated setups. Or at least what we thought were isolated setups.

**Sera:** Quantum entanglement really is amazing.

**Sera:** Okay, can you set up the other two experiments while I set up Dr. Chen's experiment to run in parallel?

***Sequenced Recall Minigame.***

##### Coffee
---
**Alex:** *It took a long time to set up all the experiments to run. We wanted to make sure everything is set up correctly, so we were meticulous, taking our time and triple checking our work as well as each other's. But it wasn't tedious at all - we were both very excited.*

**Alex:** *By the time we were done, it was late. So late that it was technically early. As in... it's too late to go home - we'd just end up going back here in a few hours anyway.*

**Alex:** *So we settled for lots of coffee and a very early breakfast in the break room.*

**Sera:** I'm going to grab us breakfast at Tony's. Can you make the coffee? Black with two sugar cubes, thanks.

**Alex:** Sure.

***Coffee Minigame - make both Alex's and Sera's coffees.***

***If Sera's coffee is done correctly:***
	**Sera:** I haven't pulled an all-nighter since grad school.
	**Sera:** Coffee's good - you should consider working at a cafe.
		***Dialogue option 1 - lowers relationship with Sera slightly.***
			**Alex:** I'm a researcher, not a barista.
			**Sera:** It was a joke...
			**Result:** Sera dislikes that response.
		***Dialogue option 2.***
			**Alex:** Thanks.
		***Dialogue option 3 - raises relationship with Sera a lot. Set CoffeeConversation Variable.***
			**Alex:** I wouldn't mind owning a coffee franchise. Growing my own coffee beans, roasting them, hosting coffee tastings -
			**Sera:** Seriously?
			**Alex:** I love coffee.
			**Result:** Sera loves the response. She'll remember this.
***If Sera's coffee is done incorrectly:***
	**Sera:** ...
	**Alex:** What?
	**Sera:** Nothing... Just not what I expected.

**Alex:** So what are we going to do if this reproduces the surges in Dr. Chen's data?

**Alex:** *Sera's tired eyes brightened at the thought.*

**Sera:** What do you think?

**Alex:** You think it's possible?

**Sera:** The theories think so.

**Sera:** Although in the meantime, we might as well let the lab know.

**Alex:** *For the first time that I could remember, something bothered me about that. I can't tell why, but one thought did dominate the rest - why does she even bother?*

**Sera:** What?

**Alex:** *Dammit. She needs to stop reading me so much.*

**Alex:** Why? They didn't seem to care that much about it.

**Sera:** This is how science progresses. You need to share your findings with others, just like they share their findings with you. Because knowledge isn't a one-man task.

**Sera:** But I don't think that's really what you're trying to say.

**Alex:** They don't like you.

**Sera:** What does that have to do with anything?

**Alex:** ...

**Alex:** *My silence was met with a small smile from her.*

**Sera:** I appreciate the concern. Really. But sharing information with only people who like me is not how I do things. After all, people share information with me all the time even when we hate each other.
