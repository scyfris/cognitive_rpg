##### Alex Being Questioned
---
***After Alex's morning routine and he comes into the office and finishes work routine, Wei turns to him.***

**Wei:** Hey, you were working with Sera trying to reproduce Dr. Chen's data, right?

**Alex:** Yeah.

**Wei:** How did you guys do it? We spent days trying...

**Alex:** Well, we...

**Alex:** *Wait... Did Sera not tell everyone how to do it?*

**Alex:** *Right... her email only mentioned that we were able to reproduce the data. Not how.*

**Alex:** ...

**Wei:** Yes?

**Alex:** I, uh... have to go.

***Alex runs out of the office. Cue game to get to the lab.***

##### Starting a New Research Project
---
**Alex:** *I don't know how I knew Sera would be in the lab instead of at her desk. But there she is. Now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen her at her desk.*

***Sound of door slamming open.***

**Alex:** Sera!

***Sera is startled.***

**Sera:** Wh-what?

**Alex:** Did you tell anyone about how we reproduced Dr. Chen's data?

**Sera:** Will you calm down? You nearly gave me a heart attack, slamming the door open and yelling like a maniac.

**Alex:** Sorry...

**Sera:** To answer your question, no, I did not. I wanted to -

**Alex:** Don't.

**Sera:** Sorry?

**Alex:** Don't tell anyone. Not yet. Instead, let's put in a research proposal.

**Alex:** *Sera's eyebrows furrowed, and her lips turned into a frown.*

**Sera:** I'm not a fan of underhanded dealings, Dr. Wright. Transparency between team members is crucial to research. Even if we get recognition -

**Alex:** It's not for recognition. And this isn't underhanded. This is far outside the scope of Dr. Chen's project and needs its own project.

**Sera:** And what is this project?

**Alex:** Building a Time Machine.

**Alex:** *Sera's eyebrows shot up, and she stared at me as though trying to comprehend what I just said. I think I'm crazy too, but I mean... this had been in everyone's mind since we saw Dr. Chen's data, right?*

**Alex:** *The only difference is that everyone else thought in theories. Me and my brain drunk on science fiction, I was already thinking of making it a reality.*

**Alex:** *However... the longer Sera stared at me, the more I see the Sera I've gotten to know. To be honest, I think she was surprised that I had actually suggested it more so than she was at the actual suggestion. Heck, she would've probably pursued it herself without me suggesting it.*

**Sera:** That... is far outside the scope of Dr. Chen's project.

**Alex:** Exactly. I'm not saying we don't give them credit. But everyone had access to the same data we had, everyone else decided not to pursue the anomalies, and the reproduction of Dr. Chen's weird data had nothing to do with Dr. Chen's actual project. It involved two other independent experiments running simultaneously.

**Sera:** ...

**Sera:** It would be nice to get our own funding and resources.

**Sera:** Fine, you've convinced me. But we need to be transparent with the team about our intentions.

**Alex:** They won't like it.

**Sera:** They don't like a lot of things. Okay, why don't you get started on the proposal and I'll talk to the team?

**Alex:** Are you sure -

**Sera:** I've dealt with this type of situation plenty of times.

**Alex:** *That's true... I've heard her - she's a lot better at it than me. It's just...*

**Alex:** *After last time, I don't want her to have to deal with that again.*
