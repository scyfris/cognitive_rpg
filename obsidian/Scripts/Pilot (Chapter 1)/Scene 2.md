##### Introduction
---
***The camera pans around the office before focusing back on Alex, after which a sigh can be heard.***

**Alex:** *Back to the daily grind…*
**Alex:** *This is the Quantum Physics National Laboratory.*
**Alex:** *I’ve been working here for about a year or so now.*

***A few seconds pass.***

**Alex:** *Time really… passes. Slowly but it passes. We should add a footnote to the Theory of Relativity.*
**Alex:** …
**Alex:** *Well, food’s needed on the table, so let’s get to work. Off to my desk!*

***Pans out to larger view of the office. Navigating office minigame starts.***

##### Navigating Office Minigame
---
***Alex says various things just to fill out the silence. You can't really fail this game.***

***One***
	**Alex:** *I don't know why they designed the office this way. It's like they're trying their best to make getting to work as hard as possible.*
***Two***
	**Alex:** *Where am I?*
***Three***
	**Alex:** *Maybe I shouldn't have taken that one turn? Or was it the other turn?*
***Four***
	**Alex:** *I should have just worked from home.*
***Five***
	**Alex:** *This place was probably designed by an intern.*
	**Alex:** *"Hey, you're new! Design our office space!"*
	**Alex:** *...*
	**Alex:** *No, this place was definitely designed by a researcher.*

***After Alex reaches his desk, the next minigame can start.***

##### After Alex reaches his desk
---
**Alex:** *Finally!*

**Alex:** *Let’s see… I should probably review those papers for the journal. I also need some more data for my next paper. I am part of the research team for Dr. Chen's research, but researchers usually also work on other projects simultaneously and head their own projects. I actually have my own research going on...*

**Alex:** …

**Alex:** *Although at this point, I’m not really sure how much of it is my paper vs. everyone else’s.*

**Alex:** *I mean, I didn’t have much input into it, despite being the research lead. I’m kinda just doing what they tell me to do.*

**Alex:** ...

**Alex:** *I'm not bitter. Really. It's... not really their fault.*

**Alex:** *I'm just bad at communication, specifically with people who know me but whom I don't... trust.*

##### Reviewing Papers Minigame
---
***First time playing.***
	**Alex**: This is probably the easiest part of my job - reviewing candidate journal papers.
	**Alex:** Mainly because the authors don't know who the reviewers are.
	**Alex**: Help me write a readable email by choosing the most logical word choice.
	**Alex:** Okay, let's get to work.

***Subsequent times playing.***
	**Alex:** Remember - choose the most logical word choice.
	**Alex:** Let's get to work.

***Failure.***
**Alex**: Hmm... That doesn't feel right.
**Alex**: I should probably double-check.

***Success - after a full email written.***
**Alex**: Awesome. One email down.

##### Emails
---
***These are the emails in the minigame.***

**Email:** 

**Subject: Review: Exploring Quantum Entanglement in Multi-Particle Systems**

**Paper Summary**: This study looks at how entangled particles behave when there are many of them together. It introduces a new way to think about and understand particle entanglement.

**Review Comments**:
	**Strengths**: The new theory introduced is very promising, and the math backing it up is strong. This theory could really change how we understand quantum systems.
    **Limitations**: The experiments needed to test this theory can't be done with our current technology. The authors should explain what new technology is needed to make these experiments possible.
    **Suggestions**: The paper would be better if it talked about any real-world problems that might impact the theory. Comparing this new model to older ones could also help show what makes it special.
    **Recommendation**: Approve the paper, but ask for some small changes first.

**Email:**

**Subject: Review: Theoretical Limits of Quantum Computing Speed**

**Paper Summary**: This paper investigates how fast quantum computers can possibly work, looking at both theoretical ideas and practical limitations.

**Review Comments**:
	**Strengths**: The paper makes strong arguments about the maximum speeds achievable by quantum computers. The mathematical proofs are detailed and comprehensive.
    **Limitations**: The discussion focuses heavily on theory and lacks attention to practical scenarios, potentially narrowing its interest to a wider audience.
    **Suggestions**: Making some of the more technical parts easier to understand and including discussions on how these theories could be applied in real-world situations would make the paper more accessible and influential.
    **Recommendation**: Approve the paper, but ask for some small changes first.

**Email:**

**Subject: Review: Quantum State Transfer via Nano-Electromechanical Systems**

**Paper Summary**: This research introduces a new method for moving quantum states using nano-electromechanical systems.

**Review Comments**:
	**Strengths**: The use of nanotechnology in quantum information science is both groundbreaking and full of potential. The experimental setup and the preliminary results are promising.
    **Limitations**: The paper does not address how the environment will impact the technology's performance.
    **Suggestions**: The paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion on the technology's performance in different environmental conditions. Additional data on the system's stability would also enhance the research.
    **Recommendation**: Approve the paper, but substantial revisions are needed first.

***At this point, Alex hears someone saying, "ARE YOU SERIOUS???" Cue Seraphina’s argument with another researcher - Mark.***

##### Argument between Seraphina and Mark
---
**Mark:** ...there *might* be a hidden variable theory that explains quantum entanglement.

**Alex:** *Seriously? Hidden variables? Hidden variables have been -*

**Sera:** - thoroughly debunked since the days of Bell's theorem. Stop inventing things to suit your theories!

**Mark:** Aren't you being rather close-minded? After all -

**Sera:** It has nothing to do with me. It's about following the evidence, grounded in reason and not wishful thinking.

**Mark:** Well, science is about pushing boundaries and challenging assumptions, isn't it?

**Sera:** It's also about being rigorous and respecting the scientific method.

**Alex:** *Ouch.*

*Sera marches away, leaving Mark fuming.*

**Alex:** *...*

**Alex:** *Sera's not one to mince words. If I could only be half as eloquent, most of my problems wouldn't be problems.*

*The researcher next to Alex's desk turns to him.*

**Alex:** *This is Wei. We work next to each other. And that's pretty much all I know about him.*

**Wei:** What do you think?

**Alex:** *Uh... what?*

**Wei:** Were you not listening to those two? What do you think?

**Alex:** *Oh, the conversation between Sera and Mark.*

**Alex:** *Honestly, I'd rather not get on either of their bad sides, if I can help it. But he seems to want me to choose a side.*

**Alex:** *No, Alex! You have to learn to stand up for yourself. Tell him what you really think! Mark was wrong, and -*

**Alex:** Well, I...

**Alex:** ...

**Alex:** ...

**Wei:** If you ask me, someone needs to knock that woman down a notch. She's right, of course, but what is her problem? She acts as though she has something against all of us. She probably *has* something against all of us.

*Wei turns back to his work.*

**Alex:** *...*

**Alex:** *...I need to start up a few experiments.*

##### Starting Experiments Minigame
---
***First time playing.***
	**Alex:** I need to run some more experiments to fill in some gaps in our data.
	**Alex:** Choose the correct variables to set to fill in the data gaps.

***Subsequent times playing.***
	**Alex:** Remember - choose the correct variables to set to fill in the data gaps in the experimental data.
	**Alex:** Let's get to work.

***Failure.***
**Alex:** These numbers won't work...
**Alex:** I should double check my work.

***Success.***
**Alex:** Everything seems to be in order. Great!

##### Conclusion
---
**Alex:** Finally. The work day is finally over.

**Alex:** I can't wait to get home and relax.
