### Scene 2: Argument between Seraphina and another researcher
---
**Researcher:** ...there *might* be a hidden variable theory that explains quantum entanglement.

**Alex:** *Seriously? Hidden variables? Hidden variables have been -*

**Sera:** - thoroughly debunked since the days of Bell's theorem. Stop inventing things to suit your theories.

**Researcher:** Aren't you being rather close-minded? After all -

**Sera:** It has nothing to do with me. It's about following the evidence, grounded in reason and not wishful thinking.

**Researcher:** Well, I still think there's room for exploration, even if it means revisiting some discarded ideas. Science is about pushing boundaries and challenging assumptions, isn't it?

**Sera:** It's also about being rigorous and respecting the scientific method.

**Alex:** *Ouch.*

*Sera marches away, leaving the researcher fuming.*

**Alex:** *...*

**Alex:** *Sera's not one to mince words. If I could only be half as eloquent, most of my problems wouldn't be problems. See, most of my problems come from the fact that -*

**Alex:** *- I suck at talking.*

**Alex:** *When someone tries to talk to me -*

*The researcher next to Alex's desk turns to him.*

**Alex:** *This is Wei. We work next to each other. And that's pretty much all I know about him.*

**Wei:** What do you think?

**Alex:** *Uh... what? Crap... have I been ignoring him this whole time? What is he talking about?*

**Wei:** Were you not listening to those two? What do you think?

**Alex:** *Oh, the conversation between Sera and Mark.*

**Alex:** *Honestly, I'd rather not get on either of their bad sides, if I can help it. But he seems to want me to choose a side.*

**Alex:** *No, Alex! You have to learn to stand up for yourself. Tell him what you really think! Mark was wrong, and -*

**Alex:** I, uh, I mean... no, I think, um...

**Alex:** *Wei looks like he's getting more and more exasperated with my stammering every passing second. I don't blame him. At least, he's trying to be polite.*

**Wei:** *sigh* How did you pass the job interviews?

**Alex:** *... I didn't. They hired me because they were impressed with my thesis, not for my speaking ability.*

**Wei:** If you ask me, someone needs to knock that woman down a notch. She's right, of course, but what is her problem? She acts as though she has something against all of us. She probably *has* something against all of us.

*Wei turns back to his work.*

**Alex:** *This is what I'm talking about. I suck at talking.*
