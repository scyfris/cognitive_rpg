##### Introduction
---
***The camera pans around the office before focusing back on Alex, after which a sigh can be heard.***

**Alex:** *Back to the daily grind…*
**Alex:** *This is the Quantum Physics National Laboratory.*
**Alex:** *I’ve been working here for about a year or so now.*

***A few seconds pass.***

**Alex:** *Time really… passes. Slowly but it passes. Who knew high speeds were unnecessary for time dilation?*
**Alex:** …
**Alex:** *Well, food’s needed on the table, so let’s get to work. Off to my desk!*

***Pans out to larger view of the office. Navigating office minigame starts.***

##### Navigating Office Minigame
---
***Alex says various things just to fill out the silence. You can't really fail this game.***

***One***
	**Alex:** *I don't know why they designed the office this way. It's like they're trying their best to make getting to work as hard as possible.*
***Two***
	**Alex:** *Where am I?*
***Three***
	**Alex:** *Maybe I shouldn't have taken that one turn? Or was it the other turn?*
***Four***
	**Alex:** *I should have just worked from home.*
***Five***
	**Alex:** *This place was probably designed by an intern.*
	**Alex:** *"Hey, you're new! Design our office space!"*
	**Alex:** *...*
	**Alex:** *No, this place was definitely designed by a researcher.*

***After Alex reaches his desk, the next minigame can start.***

##### After Alex reaches his desk
---
**Alex:** *Finally!*

**Alex:** *Let’s see… I should probably review those papers for the journal. I also need some more data for our next paper…*

**Alex:** …

**Alex:** *Although at this point, I’m not really sure how much of it is my paper vs. everyone else’s.*

**Alex:** *I mean, I didn’t have much input into it. I’m kinda just doing what they tell me to do.*

**Alex:** ...

**Alex:** *I'm not bitter. Really. It's... not really their fault.*

**Alex:** *It's mine.*

##### Reviewing Papers Minigame
---
***First time playing.***
	**Alex**: I need to send out some emails with my reviews for the candidate journal papers.
	**Alex**: Help me write a readable email by choosing the most logical word choice.
	**Alex:** Okay, let's get to work.

***Subsequent times playing.***
	**Alex:** Remember - choose the most logical word choice.
	**Alex:** Let's get to work.

***Failure.***
**Alex**: Hmm... That doesn't feel right.
**Alex**: I should probably double-check.

***Success - after a full email written.***
**Alex**: Awesome. One email down.

##### Emails
---
***These are the emails in the minigame.***

**Email:** 

**Subject: Review: Exploring Quantum Entanglement in Multi-Particle Systems**

**Paper Summary**: This study examines the complex interactions of quantum entanglement in systems with several particles. It offers a new theoretical approach to understanding these interactions.

**Review Comments**:
	**Strengths**: The introduction of a novel theoretical model is impressive, and the mathematical support provided is robust. The potential to expand our understanding of quantum systems is significant.
    **Limitations**: The proposed experiments to validate the theory are not feasible with existing technology. The authors should outline what technological advancements are necessary.
    **Suggestions**: Adding analysis on how practical issues might affect the model would enhance the paper. A comparison with existing entanglement models would also clarify its unique contributions.
    **Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.

**Email:**

**Subject: Review: Testing Time-Reversal Symmetry in Quantum Teleportation**

**Paper Summary**: This paper tests the concept of time-reversal in quantum teleportation processes using photonic qubits.

**Review Comments**:
	**Strengths**: The experimental design is solid, and the presentation of results using photonic qubits is clear and well-executed.
    **Limitations**: The paper lacks depth in statistical analysis and the error margins are not adequately discussed. The implications of the findings are too speculative.
    **Suggestions**: More rigorous experiments are needed to bolster the statistical significance of the results. A detailed error analysis would also benefit the study.
    **Recommendation**: Accept with major revisions.

**Email:**

**Subject: Review: Theoretical Limits of Quantum Computing Speed**

**Paper Summary**: This paper explores the upper limits of processing speed in quantum computing, considering different theoretical and practical constraints.

**Review Comments**:
	**Strengths**: The paper provides a deep theoretical analysis and presents compelling arguments about the speed limits of quantum computing. The mathematical proofs are thorough.
    **Limitations**: The discussion is very theoretical with little attention to real-world applications, which might limit its appeal to a broader audience.
    **Suggestions**: Simplifying some technical sections and discussing potential real-world applications would make the paper more accessible and impactful.
    **Recommendation**: Accept with minor revisions.

**Email:**

**Subject: Review: Quantum State Transfer via Nano-Electromechanical Systems**

**Paper Summary**: This research introduces a new technique for transferring quantum states using nano-electromechanical systems.

**Review Comments**:
	**Strengths**: The approach of using nanotechnology in quantum information science is both innovative and promising. The experimental setup and initial findings are encouraging.
    **Limitations**: The scalability of the technology and its robustness against environmental disturbances are not well-addressed.
    **Suggestions**: Expand discussions on how the system can be scaled and how it performs under various environmental conditions. More stability data would also be valuable.
    **Recommendation**: Accept with major revisions.

***At this point, Alex hears someone saying, "ARE YOU SERIOUS???" Cue Seraphina’s argument with another researcher - Mark.***

##### Scene 2: Argument between Seraphina and Mark
---
**Mark:** ...there *might* be a hidden variable theory that explains quantum entanglement.

**Alex:** *Seriously? Hidden variables? Hidden variables have been -*

**Sera:** - thoroughly debunked since the days of Bell's theorem. Stop inventing things to suit your theories.

**Mark:** Aren't you being rather close-minded? After all -

**Sera:** It has nothing to do with me. It's about following the evidence, grounded in reason and not wishful thinking.

**Mark:** Well, I still think there's room for exploration, even if it means revisiting some discarded ideas. Science is about pushing boundaries and challenging assumptions, isn't it?

**Sera:** It's also about being rigorous and respecting the scientific method.

**Alex:** *Ouch.*

*Sera marches away, leaving Mark fuming.*

**Alex:** *...*

**Alex:** *Sera's not one to mince words. If I could only be half as eloquent, most of my problems wouldn't be problems.*

*The researcher next to Alex's desk turns to him.*

**Alex:** *This is Wei. We work next to each other. And that's pretty much all I know about him.*

**Wei:** What do you think?

**Alex:** *Uh... what? Crap... have I been ignoring him this whole time? What is he talking about?*

**Wei:** Were you not listening to those two? What do you think?

**Alex:** *Oh, the conversation between Sera and Mark.*

**Alex:** *Honestly, I'd rather not get on either of their bad sides, if I can help it. But he seems to want me to choose a side.*

**Alex:** *No, Alex! You have to learn to stand up for yourself. Tell him what you really think! Mark was wrong, and -*

**Alex:** I, uh, I mean... no, I think, um...

**Alex:** *Wei looks like he's getting more and more exasperated with my stammering every passing second. I don't blame him. At least, he's trying to be polite.*

**Wei:** *sigh* How did you pass the job interviews?

**Alex:** *... I didn't. They hired me because they were impressed with my thesis, not for my speaking ability.*

**Wei:** If you ask me, someone needs to knock that woman down a notch. She's right, of course, but what is her problem? She acts as though she has something against all of us. She probably *has* something against all of us.

*Wei turns back to his work.*

**Alex:** *This is what I'm talking about. I suck at talking. At communication in general - specifically with people who...*

**Alex:** *...*

**Alex:** *...I need to start up a few experiments.*
