##### Alex Returns Home
---
***When Alex arrives home, Dillon is already in the kitchen, working on what looks to be an electric skateboard.***

**Dillon:** You're not going to start staying at work late, are you?

**Alex:** I think I might be.

**Dillon:** Wow. "I hate my job so much I'm going to work overtime."

**Alex:** It's not like that. I wouldn't even count this as work since no one is really... wanting me to do it except me and Sera -

**Dillon:** The lady who got a whole research team fired because she showed that their data was fabricated? The lady whose research caused her parents' key legislation to fail? That was badass, and the research wasn't even in quantum physics...

**Alex:** That's her... Wait, her parents are politicians?

**Dillon:** *Were* politicians. After that debacle, her parents were found to be taking bribes from the chemical companies of interest. That was why they were pushing that legislation so hard.

**Alex:** How did you find out about this? I didn't know this, and I'm her colleague!

**Dillon:** I looked her up after you told me about her.

**Dillon:** Anyway, stay at work.

**Alex:** I thought you don't like me working?

**Dillon:** I don't like you being a masochistic doormat. This is different.
