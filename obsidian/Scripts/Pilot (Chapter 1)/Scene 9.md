##### Setting Up for Video Game Tournament
---
***Saturday morning is the next morning. Alex needs to set up his apartment in preparation for the video game tournament. This is a game that is basically the puzzle game - move things into place. No failure possible.***

**Alex:** Alright, let's get this place set up.

***When done:***

**Alex:** Looks like everything's set.

##### The Party Begins
---
***The sound of knocking can be heard before Dillon comes in.***

**Dillon:** Alright! You're all ready to go! Normally I have to drag you to do it.

**Alex:** *Dillon had a mischievous look on his face. I don't like it.*

**Dillon:** What's the occasion?

**Alex:** Sera's coming.

**Dillon:** What? No way.

**Alex:** ...

**Dillon:** You invited someone over? You invited a *girl* over?

***More knocking can be heard before Dillon's friends come filing in, and the scene blacks out before their setups fill the area.***

**Dillon:** Alright, before we get this on the road, we need to sort out our pizza situation. What pizza does everyone want?

**Friend 1:** Pepperoni!

**Friend 2:** I'm vegetarian, you wanker!

**Friend 2:** And just so you know, you're contributing to the deaths of -

**Dillon:** Alright, so half pepperoni and half veggies -

**Friend 2:** Hold on - my half would be touching those abominable slices of dead flesh -

**Friend 3:** How about we just get cheese -

**Friend 1:** Dude, protein is important!

**Alex:** *Every time...*

***More knocking can be heard before Sera enters. Everyone becomes quiet for an awkward second or two.***

**Sera:** Um... hi.

**Alex:** *This is the first time I've seen Sera look so awkward.*

**Alex:** Guys, this is Sera, one of my colleagues from work. Sera, this is Dillon, Duke, James, and Mia.

**Duke:** I didn't know you have friends - *ow!* - I meant outside of us - *ow!* - WILL YOU CUT IT OUT???

**Mia:** Can't you just say hi without being weird?

**Mia:** Just ignore him.

**Dillon:** Okay then! Introductions are done! Game time!

##### Round 1 - Tapping Game
---
***For this game, just recycle from our other minigame.***

***After the round is finished:***

**Sera:** You know, Dr. Wright, I didn't think you were the type to play video games, let alone host a... what?

**Dillon:** Pffffft. What did you call him?

**Sera:** ...Dr. Wright?

**Dillon:** I keep forgetting he has a Ph D. He's just Al, or Alex, to us.

**Alex:** She can call me whatever she wants.

***If relationship with Sera is bad:***
	**Sera:** I'll stick to Dr. Wright, thanks. We're not really that close.
***If relationship with Sera is good:***
	**Sera:** I'll stick to Dr. Wright for now, if that's okay with you. I don't really know you that well...
	**Dillon:** Sounds like she wants to get to know you better, Al.
	**Sera:** I didn't say that.
	**Dillon:** You don't want to get to know him?
	**Sera:** Well, I...
	**Alex:** Dillon, shut up. You're making things weird.

**Dillon:** Alright, alright, next round!

##### Round 2 - Tapping Game
---
***After the round is finished:***

**Mia:** Damn, Sera. You sure you've never played the game before?

**Sera:** I'm sure. I don't really play games that much.

**Mia:** Neither does Alex.

**Sera:** Why does he host these parties then?

**Dillon:** Because I make him. It's for his own good because otherwise, he would just be a loner with nothing other than work to keep himself occupied.
