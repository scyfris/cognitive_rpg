##### Setting Up for Video Game Tournament
---
***Saturday morning is the next morning. Alex needs to set up his apartment in preparation for the video game tournament. This is a game that is basically the puzzle game - move things into place. No failure possible.***

**Alex:** Alright, let's get this place set up.

***When done:***

**Alex:** Looks like everything's set.

##### The Party Begins
---
***The sound of knocking can be heard before Dillon comes in.***

**Dillon:** Alright! You're all ready to go! Normally I have to drag you to do it.

**Alex:** *Dillon had a mischievous look on his face. I don't like it.*

**Dillon:** What's the occasion?

**Alex:** Sera's coming.

**Dillon:** What? No way.

**Alex:** ...

**Dillon:** You invited someone over? You invited a *girl* over?

***More knocking can be heard before Dillon's friends come filing in, and the scene blacks out before their setups fill the area.***

**Dillon:** Alright, before we get this on the road, we need to sort out our pizza situation. What pizza does everyone want?

**Friend 1:** Pepperoni!

**Friend 2:** I'm vegetarian, you wanker!

**Friend 2:** And just so you know, you're contributing to the deaths of -

**Dillon:** Alright, so half pepperoni and half veggies -

**Friend 2:** Hold on - my half would be touching those abominable slices of dead flesh -

**Friend 3:** How about we just get cheese -

**Friend 1:** Dude, protein is important!

**Alex:** *Every time...*

***More knocking can be heard before Sera enters. Everyone becomes quiet for an awkward second or two.***

**Sera:** Um... hi.

**Alex:** *This is the first time I've seen Sera look so awkward.*

**Alex:** Guys, this is Sera, one of my colleagues from work. Sera, this is Dillon, Duke, James, and Mia.

**Duke:** I didn't know you have friends - *ow!* - I meant outside of us - *ow!* - WILL YOU CUT IT OUT???

**Mia:** Can't you just say hi without being weird?

**Mia:** Just ignore him.

**Dillon:** Okay then! Introductions are done! Game time!

##### Round 1 - Tapping Game
---
***For this game, just recycle from our other minigame.***

***After the round is finished:***

**Sera:** You know, Dr. Wright, I didn't think you were the type to play video games, let alone host a... what?

**Dillon:** Pffffft. What did you call him?

**Sera:** ...Dr. Wright?

**Dillon:** I keep forgetting he has a Ph D. He's just Al, or Alex, to us.

**Alex:** She can call me whatever she wants.

***If relationship with Sera is bad:***
	**Sera:** I'll stick to Dr. Wright, thanks. We're not really that close.
***If relationship with Sera is good:***
	**Sera:** I'll stick to Dr. Wright for now, if that's okay with you. I don't really know you that well...
	**Dillon:** Sounds like she wants to get to know you better, Al.
	**Sera:** I didn't say that.
	**Dillon:** You don't want to get to know him?
	**Sera:** Well, I...
	**Alex:** Dillon, shut up. You're making things weird.

**Dillon:** Alright, alright, next round!

##### Round 2 - Tapping Game
---
***After the round is finished:***

**Mia:** Damn, Sera. You sure you've never played the game before?

**Sera:** I'm sure. I don't really play games that much.

**Mia:** Neither does Alex.

**Sera:** Why does he host these parties then?

**Dillon:** Because I make him. It's for his own good because otherwise, he would just be a loner with nothing other than work to keep himself occupied.

***Dialogue option 1 - set variable AlexFreePizza.***
	**Alex:** I became a charity case when he discovered free pizza.
	**Dillon:** Free food is part of hosting. And you are the best host.
***Dialogue option 2 - set variable AlexStableInternet***
	**Alex:** The protection of his wings stretches as far as stable internet.
	**Dillon:** You have fiber. I have satellite. 
**Result:** Sera will remember this.

##### Round 3 - Tapping Game
---
***After the game is finished, the screen fades to black with the following message.***

**Alex's Voice:** *The games continued until late at night. Eventually though, people got tired, and Dillon had to end it. I'm sure if he had the choice though, he could go on all night. As is, we all said our goodbyes with promises to meet up again next week, and people filed out until it was just me and Sera.*

***The screen fades in to show Alex and Sera.***

**Sera:** Thanks for inviting me. It was a lot of fun.

**Alex:** Feel free to come by for next week.

**Sera:** I will.
