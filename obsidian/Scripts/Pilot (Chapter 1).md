### Scene 1: Alex at his house
---
Location: Alex's apartment

**Alex's Voice:** When I was younger, I used to dream about being a scientist. Not in the realistic way, mind you. That's what happens when your head is always stuck in a science fiction novel. Besides, I was a child - how was I supposed to know what being a scientist is really like?

I imagined myself clad in a white lab coat, unlocking the secrets of the universe. My romantic fantasies stretched as far as my imagination would allow them, far away from the little house I grew up in...

*Alarm sounds. A tapping sound like someone turning it off. A sigh. Alex wakes up in his apartment.*

**Alex:** Coffee...

*After he makes coffee, he sits down to look at emails.*

**Email:** We are excited to announce an upcoming seminar on the latest advancements in quantum computing. Dr. Rodriguez from the Quantum Information Science group will be presenting on May 20 at 11am. Please mark your calendars, and we encourage everyone interested in this cutting-edge field to attend.

**Alex:** I should probably put that down. Sounds interesting.

*After he notes that on his calendar, next email.*

**Email:** As part of our ongoing commitment to safety, we remind all members that the annual safety training is due by April 15. Please complete the online modules and attend the scheduled hands-on sessions on April 10 and April 11 to ensure a safe working environment for all. Your cooperation is crucial for the well-being of our community.

**Alex:** Not this again. Have they never heard of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle? "The more you know about safety, the less certain you are about getting through the day without accident."

**Alex:** I should probably note that down though.

*After he notes that on his calendar, next email.*

**Email:** 

**Subject: Re: Update: Quantum Entanglement Experiment Progress**

**From: Michael Chen**

Hi Team,

I noticed fluctuations in the entanglement correlation that, at first glance, appear unrelated to external factors. However, I suspect it might be due to our environmental monitoring and experimental setup. Let's discuss this at our next meeting.

Best,
Mike

**Alex:** Sounds good to me.

**Email:** 

**Subject: Take a look at this artifact**

**From: Dr. Vytautas Kazlauskas**

Dear Alex,

I know this is probably coming out of nowhere, but I'm an archaeologist from Vilnius University and I would like to show you an artifact for you to take a look at.

Best,
Dr. Vytautas Kazlauskas

**Alex:** ...that's not sketchy at all. I thought IT filters out spam mail. I guess some still make it through.

**Alex:** Delete, and that's all. Time to get to the lab.

### Scene 2: Argument between Seraphina and another researcher
---
**Researcher:** ...there *might* be a hidden variable theory that explains quantum entanglement.

**Alex:** *Seriously? Hidden variables? Hidden variables have been -*

**Sera:** - thoroughly debunked since the days of Bell's theorem. Stop inventing things to suit your theories.

**Researcher:** Aren't you being rather close-minded? After all -

**Sera:** It has nothing to do with me. It's about following the evidence, grounded in reason and not wishful thinking.

**Researcher:** Well, I still think there's room for exploration, even if it means revisiting some discarded ideas. Science is about pushing boundaries and challenging assumptions, isn't it?

**Sera:** It's also about being rigorous and respecting the scientific method.

**Alex:** *Ouch.*

*Sera marches away, leaving the researcher fuming.*

**Alex:** *...*

**Alex:** *Sera's not one to mince words. If I could only be half as eloquent, most of my problems wouldn't be problems. See, most of my problems come from the fact that -*

**Alex:** *- I suck at talking.*

**Alex:** *When someone tries to talk to me -*

*The researcher next to Alex's desk turns to him.*

**Alex:** *This is Wei. We work next to each other. And that's pretty much all I know about him.*

**Wei:** What do you think?

**Alex:** *Uh... what? Crap... have I been ignoring him this whole time? What is he talking about?*

**Wei:** Were you not listening to those two? What do you think?

**Alex:** *Oh, the conversation between Sera and Mark.*

**Alex:** *Honestly, I'd rather not get on either of their bad sides, if I can help it. But he seems to want me to choose a side.*

**Alex:** *No, Alex! You have to learn to stand up for yourself. Tell him what you really think! Mark was wrong, and -*

**Alex:** I, uh, I mean... no, I think, um...

**Alex:** *Wei looks like he's getting more and more exasperated with my stammering every passing second. I don't blame him. At least, he's trying to be polite.*

**Wei:** *sigh* How did you pass the job interviews?

**Alex:** *... I didn't. They hired me because they were impressed with my thesis, not for my speaking ability.*

**Wei:** If you ask me, someone needs to knock that woman down a notch. She's right, of course, but what is her problem? She acts as though she has something against all of us. She probably *has* something against all of us.

*Wei turns back to his work.*

**Alex:** *This is what I'm talking about. I suck at talking.*

### Scene 3: At Home: Alex Reflects on Work
---
*Alex collapses into his desk chair. Minigame starts, and he talks to himself as the minigame continues.*

**Alex:** What am I doing with my life?

**Alex:** I never thought research would make me feel so dead inside.

**Alex:** I just want to discover things, freely uncovering the mysteries of the universe.

**Alex:** That rush of excitement when pursuing the truth down the path my curiosity takes me... when's the last time I felt that?

**Alex:** It feels like everyone I talk to... they lost all sense of curiosity and love of discovery.

**Alex:** Mark today was just one example. He didn't care about the truth - he just wanted to push his theory for some reason. Until Sera pointed out that his theory depended on hidden variables.

**Alex:** He knew she was right, but he couldn't bring himself to reject his theory. Why?

**Alex:** Who knows? Maybe he hoped it would make a name for himself, so he couldn't let go of the idea. Or maybe he just wanted to prove himself right. Whatever the reason, he had lost his curiosity for the truth.

**Alex:** ...

**Alex:** Maybe I was too idealistic.

**Alex:** ...

**Alex:** Man, this is depressing...

*Phone rings.*

**Alex:** Hey, mom.

**Alex's Mom:** Hey, Alex, how are you?

**Alex:** Fine. All fine.

**Alex's Mom:** Are you planning on ever visiting? Maybe for the holidays?

**Alex:** I told you, mom - I'm not planning on ever coming back.

**Alex's Mom:** It's been years -

**Alex:** Not long enough.

**Alex's Mom:** Well... just thought I'd ask.

**Alex:** *sigh* Hey, mom, I'm pretty tired. It's been a long day.

**Alex's Mom:** Okay. I'll let you go then.

**Alex:** Thanks. I'll send you this month's funds in a couple days.

**Alex's Mom:** Okay. Well... thank you. Goodnight, Alex.

**Alex:** Night, mom.

**Alex:** *What kind of son hasn't seen his mother in almost a decade?*

### Scene 3: Dillon Comes Over
---
*There was a couple knocks on Alex's door before Dillon enters with a bunch of equipment in his arms.*

**Dillon:** What's up, man? How's it going?

**Alex:** What's that?

**Alex:** *This is Dillon. We've been friends since high school. More like brothers, actually. We went to the same... well... he's a mechanic, and I'm a researcher.*

**Alex:** *We're so close, he followed me all the way here to work.*

**Alex:** *He has his own place, but he likes to come over to mine.*

**Dillon:** No hello? You wound me, Al.

**Alex:** You've turned my whole kitchen area into a workshop! No more stuff!

**Alex:** *Dillon likes working on his own projects after work. But because he likes to come over to my place, he's decided that part of my space will be his work space. I always make a stink about it, but I don't really care.*

**Alex:** *I don't use the kitchen anyways.*

**Dillon:** Dude, you don't even use the kitchen.

**Alex:** So what are you making this time?

**Alex:** *To be honest, I actually enjoy him working on his projects in my apartment. Makes the place feel less empty.*

**Alex:** *Sometimes, he'd teach me some stuff, and actually, making stuff - it isn't that bad. It makes me feel like I'm actually doing something if that makes sense. Instead of my work going into some black hole somewhere.*

**Alex:** *Maybe I should've become a mechanic instead of a researcher.*

**Dillon:** Eh. I don't know. Maybe an electric skateboard or something.

**Alex:** Cool.

**Alex:** *And with that, we both settled into our routines. I figured I could look over Dr. Chen's data before the meeting tomorrow.*

*Math Minigame starts.*

**Alex:** What the - ?

**Alex:** *What is this? Dr. Chen's email specifically stated that the data shows fluctuations that appear unrelated to external factors. But the data here shows that the anomalies are occurring under specific experimental conditions involving extremely high-energy states.*

**Alex:** *Why did he reach such an obviously false conclusion?*

**Dillon:** What's wrong?

**Alex:** Oh... nothing. Just... work stuff.

**Dillon:** You know it's past work hours, right?

**Alex:** This is for the meeting tomorrow morning.

**Dillon:** Why bother? They don't ever listen to you anyway.
