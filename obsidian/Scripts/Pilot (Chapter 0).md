### Alex at his house
---
**Alex's Voice:** When I was younger, I used to dream about being a scientist. Not in the realistic way, mind you. That's what happens when your head is always stuck in a science fiction novel. Besides, I was a child - how was I supposed to know what being a scientist is really like?

I imagined myself clad in a white lab coat, unlocking the secrets of the universe. My romantic fantasies stretched as far as my imagination would allow them, far away from the little house I grew up in...

*Alarm sounds. A tapping sound like someone turning it off. A sigh. Alex wakes up in his apartment.*

**Alex:** Coffee...

*After he makes coffee, he sits down to look at emails.*

**Email:** We are excited to announce an upcoming seminar on the latest advancements in quantum computing. Dr. Rodriguez from the Quantum Information Science group will be presenting on May 20 at 11am. Please mark your calendars, and we encourage everyone interested in this cutting-edge field to attend.

**Alex:** I should probably put that down. Sounds interesting.

*After he notes that on his calendar, next email.*

**Email:** As part of our ongoing commitment to safety, we remind all members that the annual safety training is due by April 15. Please complete the online modules and attend the scheduled hands-on sessions on April 10 and April 11 to ensure a safe working environment for all. Your cooperation is crucial for the well-being of our community.

**Alex:** Not this again. Have they never heard of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle? "The more you know about safety, the less certain you are about getting through the day without accident."

**Alex:** I should probably note that down though.

*After he notes that on his calendar, next email.*

**Subject: Re: Update: Quantum Entanglement Experiment Progress**

**From: Michael Chen**

Hi Team,

I noticed fluctuations in the entanglement correlation that, at first glance, appear unrelated to external factors. However, I suspect it might be due to our environmental monitoring and experimental setup. Let's discuss this at our next meeting.

Best,
Mike

**Alex:** Sounds good to me.

**Email:** 

**Subject: Take a look at this artifact**

**From: Dr. Vytautas Kazlauskas**

Dear Alex,

I know this is probably coming out of nowhere, but I'm an archaeologist from Vilnius University and I would like to show you an artifact for you to take a look at.

Best,
Dr. Vytautas Kazlauskas

**Alex:** ...that's not sketchy at all. I thought IT filters out spam mail. I guess some still make it through.

**Alex:** Delete, and that's all. Time to get to the lab.

### Argument between Seraphina and another researcher
---
**Researcher:** ...there *might* be a hidden variable theory that explains quantum entanglement. Otherwise, we might as well admit magic exists!

**Sera:** Hidden variables have been thoroughly debunked since the days of Bell's theorem. Stop inventing things to suit your theories.

**Researcher:** Aren't you being rather close-minded? After all -

**Sera:** It has nothing to do with me. It's about following the evidence, grounded in reason and not wishful thinking.

**Researcher:** Maybe hidden variables aren't the answer, but we should explore different avenues.

**Sera:** You're in denial of well-established science. Quantum entanglement is nonintuitive, but that's the reality we have to accept.

**Researcher:** Well, I still think there's room for exploration, even if it means revisiting some discarded ideas. Science is about pushing boundaries and challenging assumptions, isn't it?

**Sera:** It's also about being rigorous and respecting the scientific method.
