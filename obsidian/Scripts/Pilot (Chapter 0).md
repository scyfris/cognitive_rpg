### Argument between Seraphina and another researcher
---
**Researcher:** ...there *might* be a hidden variable theory that explains quantum entanglement. Otherwise, we might as well admit magic exists!

**Sera:** Hidden variables have been thoroughly debunked since the days of Bell's theorem. Stop inventing things to suit your theories.

**Researcher:** Aren't you being rather close-minded? After all -

**Sera:** It has nothing to do with me. It's about following the evidence, grounded in reason and not wishful thinking.

**Researcher:** Maybe hidden variables aren't the answer, but we should explore different avenues. Quantum mechanics can't be the end-all, be-all explanation for everything.

**Sera:** You're in denial of well-established science. Quantum entanglement is weird and nonintuitive, but that's the reality we have to accept.

**Researcher:** Well, I still think there's room for exploration, even if it means revisiting some discarded ideas. Science is about pushing boundaries and challenging assumptions, isn't it?

**Sera:** It's also about being rigorous and respecting the scientific method.
