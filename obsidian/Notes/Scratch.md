Something that's been bothering me is the quality of our pixel art, and how to speed things up .  IT will take a lot time to get all animations and such, unless we go really low resolution which might not be that appealing.

I found this:

Doing things in blender does offer the ability to speed up things, especially animation.
One other thing to note is there are ALOT of models online for various things (desks, chairs, etc) - we can trasnfer these into our own style , but we don't have to model from scratch.  We could also use these as reference.

Just an idea.
