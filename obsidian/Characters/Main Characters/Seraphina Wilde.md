### Background
---
A war orphan, Sera didn't know her biological parents and grew up in an orphanage. She was never adopted until her teens, resulting in self-esteem issues as she saw all the kids she knew getting adopted. In her mid-teens, she was adopted by her parents - both politicians who viewed adopting a war orphan as a good look for their image.

Adopted, she was eager to please the only people she thought saw any value in her as a person. Her parents sent her to a prestigious school - where she met many other children of politicians, the wealthy, etc. Many of them adopted the behavior of their parents, and in such an environment, Sera was no different. She learned to attack her rivals in ways to make herself look better. She learned to deflect attacks at herself to keep herself from looking bad. On top of all that, she excelled in school, and her parents mentioned her in their speeches and bragged about her to their friends - a cause of great pride in Sera's mind.

However, one day, she overheard her parents talking badly about a part of their constituents - the very people she heard them proclaiming to support only that afternoon in one of their most widely broadcasted speeches. It caused her to question the world she knew, and it cracked the rose-tinted glass through which she had been seeing her parents.

This allowed her to see her parents for who they really are when she saw how vicious they were in tearing their opponents down while still making themselves look good. While people were charmed by their charisma, the conversation Sera witnessed allowed her to see through her parents' deception - their charm was a facade and nothing more. Their accomplishments and compassion were an illusion, and their civil insults were carefully crafted lies.

At this point, Sera decided to change her path - she would not go the same path as her parents - not as a career and not as a person. She forced herself to change her habits and decided to become a researcher instead of a politician. The height of her change was when she found out her parents were going to try to pass a key regulation based on "bad" science. Despite knowing it would set her parents against her, she presented research that caused her parents' legislation to fail.

Losing the support of the only people she thought to have seen any value in her, Sera began to lose her sense of worth as a person. She began to see her only worth as coming from her job and skill. Her experiences tend to reaffirm this notion.

This causes her to feel depressed often, and she would drink her feelings away. Her drinking habits have gotten her involved with her current friends, although they are more "drinking buddies" than friends. Before Alex, she was quite lonely, which she tries to forget by drinking and spending time with her drinking buddies - at least she could enjoy an illusion of friendship.

### Personality
---
Sera was a very competent researcher in quantum mechanics, and she knew it. When it comes to her job, she was outspoken and direct, not afraid to challenge her seniors and colleagues at every turn. This often causes friction between her and her fellow researchers. In contrast to her reputation, she is surprisingly soft-spoken and doesn't really raise her voice.

Due to her past, she was very strict with herself to make sure she wouldn't become like her parents. She had forced herself to adopt several behaviors - a way for her to curb her worst habits. For example, while she wasn't afraid to debate facts and argue within the context of research, she refused to engage in personal attacks or attacks on character to the point where she might not even defend herself against attacks on her character if it's too "dangerous" because she feared defending herself would cause her to fall into her old habit of deflecting from her flaws and attacking other people's character. In addition, she conscientiously tries to build people up, a way to counteract her past habit of tearing people down.

Due to losing her adoptive parents' support, she began to question and eventually lose her sense of self-worth. She felt her worth was connected to her work and skill - that her only worth came from her research and not her as a person. Her experiences tended to reaffirm this notion in her mind - i.e. her fellow researchers acknowledging her ability but assuming the worst about her as a person. As a result, Sera tends to use alcohol as a way to relieve her depression and drinks with her drinking buddies to pretend, for a moment, that she wasn't so lonely.

After her experiences with her parents, Sera appreciates sincerity and humility and detests any form of cheating, lying, and especially pretension. She reacts very positively to positive reception of her criticism - it is a direct contrast to her parents' personality and it also suggests that the person sees her for who she is, her good intentions for what they are.
