### Personality
---
When it comes to her work, Seraphina is very outspoken, ambitious, and aggressive - so much so that oftentimes, she can sound sharp and tactless when reviewing or criticizing someone's ideas. Due to the intense pressure her parents placed on her throughout her life, she has no patience for "half-assed research." This puts her at odds with many of her colleagues, many of whom get offended and defensive of her criticism.

However, while she is very hard on her colleagues, she is the hardest on herself. She doesn't get offended or defensive if criticism given her is valid, and she tends to beat herself up harshly over her mistakes. She puts herself under a lot of stress to be perfect.

While all this may suggest that she is in love with her work, she's actually very tired of the toxic atmosphere at her lab. The pressure to publish is always in the background, and people are desperate enough to try to publish "half-assed" papers (i.e. non-substantial, non-impactful, etc.). And they're even defensive over those papers.

In other words, she lives in pressure, but she hates it. At heart, she's actually a romantic when it comes to research - her dream is that one day, she could do research on her own terms, following her curiosity wherever it leads, no pressure from others, her parents, or herself.

This is why Alex's behavior peaks her interest in him. Unlike many of her colleagues, he isn't aggressive with his ideas - he is more passionate about learning than proving himself right. And he takes her criticism gracefully, never taking himself too seriously. This causes her to be able to open up to him, although for a while, she wouldn't admit it to herself that she had fallen for him - mostly because of her ingrained prejudice that "men are arrogant jerks who can't admit when they're wrong." This prejudice derives from her field being very intellectually competitive and dominated by men.

Outside of her work, Seraphina has a normal life. She has a few close friends, though none are scientists. Instead, most are artists or writers because she's drawn to their romantic outlook on life.

### Background
---
When she was younger, Seraphina showed a lot of interest and aptitude in physics. Her parents, realizing her potential and wanting to show her off to others, pressured her to study hard, at the cost of everything else. They were perfectionists and punished her harshly for mistakes, resulting in her own perfectionist tendencies.

The intense pressure causes her curiosity and love of physics to be buried, though not unrecoverable. It also causes her to desire an escape from "her reality" - which is why she enjoys spending time with writers and artists.

Once she started working, she refused to see her parents because usually they will want her to meet some people they want to show her off to. Although she will occasionally pick up their calls, the calls usually end up badly because she'll want to meet them as a family and reconcile with them while they still only view her as "their accomplishment".
