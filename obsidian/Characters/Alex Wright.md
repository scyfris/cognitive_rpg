### Personality
---
Alex is generally a shy, soft-spoken man. He tends to be reserved and rarely speaks more than is necessary. This is partially due to his poor oral communication skills, especially when it comes to speaking in a group or to people he doesn't feel comfortable around. In such social situations, he becomes very timid and nervous, causing him to stammer and forget his thoughts. However, once he becomes comfortable with someone, he converses much more normally.

His shyness belies his intelligence. He is quite sharp, easily understanding concepts he learns about and putting them to use. However, he has trouble expressing his ideas orally, preferring to demonstrate than explain. Ironically, he can put things down on paper relatively well, because he has more time to think about his words, and in his words "People aren't breathing down my neck for my answers."

College is an embarrassing topic for him because he didn't go to a prestigious university, just a local college. It's worse when he's surrounded by colleagues from some of the best colleges in the country, who, while polite, are quite obvious in their opinion about his background. College is also a sensitive topic to him because the reason he went to a community college is because his father made him do so - while legally an adult, he had still been too scared of his father to rebel.

Due to his personality and education, he tends to be dismissed and talked over by his colleagues, and he is generally too timid to defend or argue or push his ideas. He tries to talk himself into being more aggressive with his ideas, but it never works. Seraphina figures out that the reason he is so timid is because at heart, he doesn't even believe in his own ideas, no matter how sound they are - he's never had external validation to convince him otherwise.

He dreams of one day being able to change the world through his research. In a way, subconsciously, he views this as a way to validate his worth, to prove his history wrong with his childhood being the way it was and his colleagues dismissing him.

### Background
---
Alex grew up with his father and mother. His father was an abusive alcoholic, and his mother was a weary housewife who caved regularly to his father's demands. At a young age, Alex learned to fear his father, imitating his mother to avoid his wrath.

As a child, when he made a mistake, incurring his father's wrath, his father would demand he explain himself. Fear of his father caused him to stammer out unintelligible answers, which resulted in his father mocking him and beating him. He learns early on, not to defend himself or argue.

As he grew older, his father made him work and give him his earnings to pay for his alcohol addiction.

He was bright enough to get accepted to a few prestigious universities, but his father intimidated him into going to a community college. Though legally an adult, Alex's fear of his father was deeply ingrained. So ingrained in fact that he was not able to escape his father until the day his father died from overdrinking while he was still in college. At his death, Alex was finally free to pursue his doctorate, although at a average public university instead of a prestigious one because of his unimpressive college..

He has a decent relationship with his mother, whom he supports with part of his salary.

### Brainstorm

#### Future NPC like Alex's dad?
Since Alex's dad died before he could actually "deal" with him, perhaps he meets someone in the past that resembles his dad - this gives him the opportunity to say things that he never said before, or standing up for himself, or something...
