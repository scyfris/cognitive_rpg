Mid 20’s

Shy

Hopeful and optimistic. In college he wanted to be a scientist that discovers things that change the world.

Full of dreams, idealistic. nhưng timid.

“One day I’ll change the world!”

Quiet, keeps to himself. Tries to be sociable but ends up being socially awkward.

Smart, intelligent. Sharp. Can’t express his ideas that great. Better demonstrating more-so than explaining.

In his 20’s , early 20s.

Had the job for maybe a year.

Never really talk about the college he went to. Really smart, but didn’t go to a prestigous university, just went to a local college. So then he surrounded by scientists from caltech and such. Everyone just kind of dismisses him because his communication skills suck and his background wasn’t that great.

Other scientists kind of dismiss him and his theories. If he is talking about his theory. He went to no-name college, what does he know. Even though he has a journal with all his work and proofs, he never really defends himself or tries to push his theories after others dismiss him. Timid.
