### Personality
---
When it comes to her work, Seraphina is very outspoken, ambitious, and aggressive - so much so that oftentimes, she can sound sharp and tactless when reviewing or criticizing someone's ideas. Due to the intense pressure her parents placed on her throughout her life, she has no patience for "half-assed research." This puts her at odds with many of her colleagues, many of whom get offended and defensive of her criticism.

However, while she is very hard on her colleagues, she is the hardest on herself. She doesn't get offended or defensive if criticism given her is valid, and she tends to beat herself up harshly over her mistakes. She puts herself under a lot of stress to be perfect.

While all this may suggest that she is in love with her work, she's actually very tired of the toxic atmosphere at her lab. The pressure to publish is always in the background, and people are desperate enough to try to publish "half-assed" papers (i.e. non-substantial, non-impactful, etc.). And they're even willing to defend them if criticized!

In other words, she lives in pressure, but she hates it. 

### Background
---
I was born to be a scientist. My parents even gave me a really pretentious first name that was sure to stick out on all my published papers.

Attracted to protagonist after she finds out about his journals and theories. But not in an obvious way. She is much more normal than him.

She finds it interesting that Alex is not as aggressive. So she is bewildered he isn’t pushing his ideas. She is aggressive about her ideas, but she is tired of it all. She is sick of the rat race and arguing with people. This could be why she is attracted and confused by Alex - he is brilliant but doesn’t do any of that stuff.
