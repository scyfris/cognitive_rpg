I was born to be a scientist. My parents even gave me a really pretentious first name that was sure to stick out on all my published papers.

Aggressive when it comes to her ideas / research.

All the guys in the lab are kind of scared of her, because she chews out their theories all the time.

Younger guys are hella scared of her but respect her.

The older guys are miffed that a young whipersnapper is smarter than them.

Not timid.

Attracted to protagonist after she finds out about his journals and theories. But not in an obvious way. She is much more normal than him.

She finds it interesting that Alex is not as aggressive. In physics, it’s you publish or die. So she is bewildered he isn’t pushing his ideas. She is aggressive about her ideas, but she is tired of it all. She is sick of the rat race and arguing with people. This could be why she is attracted and confused by alex - he is brilliant but doesn’t do any of that stuff.This is seraphim
