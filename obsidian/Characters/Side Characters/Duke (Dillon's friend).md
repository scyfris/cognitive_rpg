### Overview
---
A mechanical engineer. Bit of a chad XD - give off vibes of Cyborg from Teen Titans. He's not black, but it's just the vibes. Likes meat. Enjoys working out. 
### Appearance
---
I imagine a pretty lean, buff dude.

### Background
---
He actually became a mechanical engineer not because he wanted to - he wanted to be a professional athlete. But his best friend caught cancer and died - his best friend wanted to be a mechanical engineer, so he just took on the dream for his friend. He had no aptitude for it, so it was through sheer willpower and persistence that he became as good as he was
