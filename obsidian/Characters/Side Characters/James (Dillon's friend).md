### Overview
---
A software engineer. British/Australian (take your pick XD). Vegetarian. Butts heads with Duke a lot. Can be a bit of an arrogant prick until you get to know him (maybe a personal quest later? P2).
### Appearance
---
Skinny, stereotypical British look, dresses nicely and fashionably all the time.  Very well-dressed. He is a little on the grouchy side, gives off grumpy old man vibes even though he is in his late 20's.

### Background
---
He had been really close with his younger brother until the latter betrayed him.

More to come.
