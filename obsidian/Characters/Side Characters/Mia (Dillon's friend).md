(major side character)
### Overview
---
An electrical engineer. Really, really good at her job. Used to be very different - a bit of a hard ass jerk who doesn't take failures from others kindly until it got her in trouble with her previous employer. She has since chilled out - a lot. Bonds with Sera very well.
### Appearance
---
Has long haair tied in a pony tail in back.  Has kind of a free-spirit vibe to her, but still grounded.
Example sprite from another game that we like can be seen here:

She has more of a normal / relaxed look - we are imagining beany, hoody, just chill.
