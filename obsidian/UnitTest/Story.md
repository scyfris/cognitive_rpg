---
Location: Bedroom

[Black screen]
Okabay - HeeeCHUU!

[Screen fades up showing Okabay in bed]
[Christina walks in the doorway]
Christina - So I see someone caught a bug.

Okabay - Ahh yes, the Organization succeeded in infiltrating my biomolecular complex with their neurotoxins... it won't be long now until full system failure...  *Cough cough*

Christina - It's called a cold.  Where are Miyuri and Daru at?  Can't they watch over you?

Okabay - I am all alone in this world.  

Christina - So they are at the Maid Cafe... got it.  Uggh okay, where are your bowls?

Okabay - ... bowls?  What contraptions are these?

Christina - You know, normal people eat out of them.  

Okabay - Oh those things.  They are in the cabinets.  What are you going to do with them?

Christina - I'm making you chicken noodle soup! That's what they do in America anyways, and it seems to work fine.

Okabay - Wait, you are *making* soup?  Ehh, I think I'm find really.  Look , all better!  *cough cough*

Christina - Don't worry, it's not a bother, really!

Okabay - Errmm... okay.  Just don't add some weird stuff, like egg plant or radishes.

[Opens up to player movement]

<If player clicks on Okabay>

Okabay - You really don't have to, you know.

Christina - It's fine. I got it!  How different can it be from mixing chemicals in the lab?

Okabay - *Thought* I hope Daru and Miyuri comes back soon

<If player clicks other objects in room - at least 3 objects>

Christina - *Thinks* <something about the object she clicks on>

[Player walks to other room - SCENE CHANGE]

<When entering room>

Christina - *Thinks* Okay, now how does one make chicken noodle soup.

<If player clicks on fridge>
[Fridge animates open]

Christina - Okay, let's see here...
	[Choices]
		* Choice 1 * - Chicken -> Goes in inventory
		* Choice 2 * - Eggplant -> Goes in inventory 
		* Choice 3 * - Slimey Chicken -> Goes in inventory
		* Choice 4 * - Gelnanas -> Goes in inventory
		* Choice 5 * - DKP -> Goes in inventory
		* Choice 6 * - Carrots -> Goes in inventory
		* Choice 7 * - Onions -> Goes in inventory
		* Choice 8 * - Pasta -> Goes in inventory

<Player puts items from inventory into the pot>
[ If she puts Eggplant, Slimey Chicken, Gelnana, DKP into pot and cooks it, she will get stinky soup back]

[ If she only puts Chicken, Carrots, Onions, and Pasta into pot, she gets normal chicken soup back]

<Cutscene of clock turning/time passing>

<Now Chicken shoup (bad or good) is in inventory>

<Player walks back to other room to give Okabay soup>

<Okabay tastes soup.  Depending on soup, the following could happen:>

[If soup was bad soup]

Okabay - Huh, doesn't taste too bad.

Christina - Wait, seriously?!

Okabay - Ya, my nose is kind of stuffy so can't taste too well, but the texture is interesting.

Christina - Oh! I'll make it for you when you aren't sick too, just so you can taste it!

Christina - *Think* Good thing he doesn't know what I put into it...

<Phone message dings>

Okabay - Hmm, my phone.  Let's see... a dmail?!

Okabay - "This is you from the future.  DO. NOT. EAT. THE. SOUP.  It will be the end of you (or at least your bowels)."

<Cutscene of the time thingy from steins gate. >
**THE END**

[If soup was good]

Okabay - Huh, this looks kind of normal.

Christina - Thanks?

Okabay - It has the texture of miso soup, if you had chicken in it.

**THE END**
