## Alex's Apartment

- Clothes hang on the "chair"
- A futon for a bed
- framed scientific paper discovering ???
- fridge
- A laptop on a desk for his workspace
- a coffee maker right next to his desk
- Kitchen is minimal - he doesn't cook cuz he eats at work
- A whiteboard on the wall with equations and designs
- a few minimalistic plants - like he wants to make his space homier but doesn't know how
- I'm imagining something like a dorm room you would find at Caltech XD

## Sera's Apartment

- Better plant life
  - Potted Plant
  - Vines and such hanging around
- Organized desk
- Big enough for roomate. I'm thinking layout should showcase large livingroom, maybe TV and art all over the walls (her roomate is an artist).  Vines hanging around, a couch.  Like a millenial girl chic modern vibe.  There is a longer hallway with doors leading into Sera's room, roomate's room, and bathroom.  At end of hall, maybe another art with a table and plant on top of it, or some other type of artifact.  Bookshelf in main living room.  Sera's room would probably have bookshelves, a bed, organized desk for studying.  What hobbies is she in to?  Does she have plushies or anything like that?  Maybe she has some cool device from a physicist she admired...
