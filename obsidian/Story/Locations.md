## Alex's Apartment

- Clothes hang on the "chair"
- A futon for a bed
- framed scientific paper discovering ???
- fridge
- A laptop on a desk for his workspace
- a coffee maker right next to his desk
- Kitchen is minimal - he doesn't cook cuz he eats at work
- A whiteboard on the wall with equations and designs
- a few minimalistic plants - like he wants to make his space homier but doesn't know how
- I'm imagining something like a dorm room you would find at Caltech XD
