### Scene 1
---
The alarm clock sounds. Alex is in bed in his apartment. He gets out and goes into the kitchen to make coffee. ==Minigame: Making Coffee (Do things in the correct order)== As he takes his coffee, he sits down to read through his emails. ==Minigame: Read Emails and Write Emails (Linguistics)== 

One email in particular catches his attention. Since he's using his work email, he doesn't expect spam. But this email is from an archaeologist asking to speak with him about their findings in Lithuania, which confuses Alex, who is a modern physicist - he doesn't know this guy. Alex decides to ignore the email and get ready for work. ==Minigame: Packing Things (Memory / Match items to words)== 

### Scene 2

At his desk, Alex overhears Seraphina and another researcher arguing. Just another day at the office...
