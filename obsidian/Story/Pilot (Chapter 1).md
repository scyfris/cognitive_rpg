### Scene 1
---
Summary:
The alarm clock sounds. Alex is in bed in his apartment. He gets out and goes into the kitchen ( to make coffee. )

==IF Patient chose memory - Minigame: Making Coffee (Do things in the correct order)==
	==chapter1_do_coffee = true==
==ELSE==
	 ==nothing==

As he takes his coffee, he sits down to read through his emails. 

==Minigame: Read Emails and Write Emails (Linguistics) and Noting Down Dates and Times (Memory)== 

One email in particular catches his attention. Since he's using his work email, he doesn't expect spam. But this email is from an archaeologist asking to speak with him about their findings in Lithuania, which confuses Alex, who is a modern physicist - he doesn't know this guy. Alex decides to ignore the email and get ready for work. ==Minigame: Packing Things (Memory / Match items to words)== 

### Scene 2
---
At his desk, Alex overhears Seraphina and another researcher arguing. Just another day at the office... 

==Minigame as the dialogue happens - These minigames give you money==

Suddenly, the researcher next to him turns to him and asks him what he thinks about the argument.

Nervous about workplace drama, Alex begins to stammer out an incoherent response. After a moment, the researcher interrupts him impatiently, telling him that while Sera is correct, he wishes someone could just knock her down a notch.

Alex doesn't respond, although he privately disagrees - in his personal opinion, Sera often has good reason to criticize researchers.

==More minigame==

### Scene 3
---
Back home, Alex collapses into his chair at his desk and begins to write in his notebook. He thinks about how he wishes his work actually makes a greater difference in the world - in the lives of the people he sees every day. Sometimes he feels his work just goes into a black hole.

==Minigame: Science Sketches and Notes

He gets a call from his mom, asking when he's planning to visit her. ==Minigame: Talking to Mom (Say things on the screen)==

As he finishes the call, he remembers his father before pushing the image of his father out of his mind.

### Scene 4
---
Next day, Alex is in the meeting with Dr. Chen regarding the strange fluctuations in the entanglement correlation in their experiments. Sera is also there, though she is being unusually quiet. While the rest of the team discusses possible issues with the experimental setup that might have caused the strange readings, Alex notices that the anomalies occur under very specific experimental conditions involving extremely high-energy states. In addition, the instruments detect unusual energy fluctuations in controlled environments where quantum states are manipulated. Alex tries to voice his opinion, but many of the researchers became impatient and dismissive over his stuttering.

Sera, clearly annoyed, snaps at them, pointing out that Alex has a point - that the fluctuations seem to suggest the presence of energy states not conforming to known principles of conventional matter. She suggests that they should investigate it.

During the confrontation, Alex observes a discomfort among the researchers. And then he realizes - they didn't want to risk time and reputation going after something so implausible. Especially when they don't even know how to replicate the results.

Dr. Chen finally dismisses the idea and returns the conversation to determining what issue with the environmental setup could cause the fluctuations.

After the meeting, Alex gathers his notes and is about to leave when Sera approaches him, asking him if he's available for lunch. He manages to stammer out a yes, and as she leaves, he wonders what she could possibly want from him.

### Scene 5
---
Alex sits down in the cafeteria for lunch, nervous about meeting with Sera.

She sits down across from him and immediately asks him what he think about the data from Dr. Chen's experiments.

Alex starts to stammer, and to his surprise, Sera's intensity and focus didn't diminish. It takes him several minutes to simply say he doesn't think the fluctuations were due to experimental setup. However, Sera continues the conversation as normal, picking his brain.

Finally, feeling rather inadequate and tired of speaking, he hands her his notes on the data.

She flips through his notes before handing it back and saying he has good points. She then asks if he'd like to investigate the energy fluctuations with her. He agrees.
