### Chapter 1
---
#### Scene 1
Sets up Alex's normal life. He wakes up in his studio and goes about his day.
	Purpose:
		Two emails are important to the story - one from Dr. Chen mentioning the fluctuations in the quantum entanglement data and one from the archaeologist.

#### Scene 2
Sets up Alex's work environment. Introduces Seraphina.
	Purpose:
		Sets up the context for Alex's external conflict - the researchers at his lab care more about being right than finding out the truth.
		Sets up Alex's relationships with his coworkers.

#### Scene 3
Alex goes home and reflects on his external conflict - no longer enjoying research because everyone around him seems to have lost their curiosity. Alex's mom calls.
	Purpose:
		Sets up Alex's external conflict.
		Hints at Alex's less than amazing childhood.

#### Scene 4
Dillon visits and Alex notices a pattern in the fluctuation data from Dr. Chen.
	Purpose:
		Introduces Dillon and Alex's relationships.
		Sets up a cliffhanger - Dr. Chen's email conflicts with what the data shows - why?

#### Scene 5
Team meeting with Dr. Chen - Alex is on the team so he's there along with Seraphina. When Alex points out the pattern in the data, he realizes why Dr. Chen's email avoids it - the pattern isn't reproducible, so publishing it basically means publishing fantastical data, which would risk their reputation. Seraphina approaches Alex after the meeting to tell him to meet her for lunch.
	Purpose:
		Showcases the external conflict between Alex and his workplace.
		Reveals a possible resolution through Seraphina.

#### Scene 6
Lunch with Seraphina. Results in them deciding to investigate this anomaly together, sacrificing time and risking scorn.
	Purpose:
		Connects Seraphina and Alex.
		Hints at softer aspects of Seraphina's personality when she's willing to listen through Alex's stuttering.
		Shows that underneath his disillusionment, Alex still loves discovery and research.

#### Scene 7
After work, they try to replicate the results of the experiment. As Dr. Chen said, even with the same setup, they couldn't replicate the results. A researcher walks in to grab something and derides them.
	Purpose:
		Sets up an emotional gut response from the researcher's derision.

#### Scene 8
Alex goes home and sees Dillon still working on the motors for his electric skateboard. He makes ramen for him, and they talk about what happened that day.
	Purpose:
		Highlights Alex's respect for Sera.

#### Scene 9
Wei confronts Alex about working with Sera. He reminds Alex of his paper that he is working on and warns him to watch out for himself - Sera's a highly ambitious researcher who might be chasing after something that she thinks will give her the most recognition even if it's clear that it will lead to nowhere.
	Purpose:
		Raise the stakes.
		Details into others' impression of Sera.

#### Scene 10
Sera and Alex are at it again trying to reproduce the data. They are tweaking different parameters, including environmental. Alex asks about her thoughts on this experiment and whether/when she thinks they should give up. Her answer surprises him.
	Purpose:
		Alex and Sera talks about the incident the other day.
		Delving into Sera's character and Alex's reactions to it.
		Sera's observation of Alex's character - specifically his low self-esteem with regards to his ideas.
		Brings forth Alex's notebook as an excuse for her to visit.

#### Scene 11
After their experiments, Alex takes Sera home to show her his notebook. Dillon invites her to their weekend game nights, to which she agrees to join.
	Purpose:
		Dillon and Sera meets.
		Sera's impressed with Alex's ideas.
		Alex makes her ramen and egg XD

#### Scene 12
As per tradition, Alex is "forced" to host video gaming tournaments on Saturdays at his studio. Really, it's just for Dillon and his friends and, now, Sera. Dillon insists it's for Alex's own good because otherwise, Alex would just be a loner with nothing other than work to keep him occupied. At the end of the night, Sera tentatively extends a reciprocating invite for Alex to visit her place for a house party the following week.
	Purpose:
		Sera and Alex meet on more casual terms.

#### Scene 13
On Monday, Sera and Alex finally hit a dead end with their experiments. Alex asks what experiments were run before Dr. Chen's experiments. They decide to try rerunning those experiments before rerunning Dr. Chen's experiments with the same parameters.
	Purpose:
		 Sera addresses his insecurities.
		 Alex finds his spark for research again and realizes a missing factor - a partner.

#### Scene 14
After pulling an all-nighter setting up the previous experiment, they finally put it on autopilot. Too early to go straight to work, but too late to go home before work, they settled for drinking coffee in the break room. Alex asks if she could help him by reviewing his paper before submission. She's surprised he asked her of all people but agrees.
	Purpose:
		Just bonding.
	 Location:
		 Break room

#### Scene 15
After work, she approaches him to give him her feedback. He takes her criticism gracefully, which she appreciates. To soften the criticism, she offers to help him improve the paper over dinner before the house party.
	Purpose:
		Hints at insecurities and opening up.

#### Scene 16
Alex sees Sera's apartment for the first time. During the party, he meets her friends and is surprised at her type of friends. He is also surprised at how much she drinks, considering he doesn't drink at all.
	Purpose:
		Foreshadows Sera's mental state and background.
	==Billy==  - I think this should be split into two scenes?  1 before party where they have their dinner together, and 1 during party.

#### Scene 17
The experiments done, Sera and Alex validate Alex's theory. The results are now reproducible. Excited, Sera comes over to Alex's to analyze the data together.
	Purpose:
		The realization of exotic matter, the presence of wormholes, and the possibility of time travel.

#### Scene 18
They start to write the joint paper on the possibility of time travel. Alex overhears Sera's conversation with her parents.
	Purpose:
		Introduces Sera's background.

#### Scene 19
When they finish the paper, before they submit it, Sera tells Alex she isn't sure she wants her name on it. Alex tells her that if that's the case, then they simply won't publish the paper. She is surprised because if they publish, it would've been a breakthrough paper.
	Purpose:
		A crucial connecting moment - neither care for recognition so much as chasing after knowledge.
		The ending cliffhanger - their intention to go on and satisfy their curiosity by trying to create a time machine.
