### Chapter 1
---
#### Scene 1
Sets up Alex's normal life. He wakes up in his studio and goes about his day.
	Purpose:
		Two emails are important to the story - one from Dr. Chen mentioning the fluctuations in the quantum entanglement data and one from the archaeologist.

#### Scene 2
Sets up Alex's work environment. Introduces Seraphina.
	Purpose:
		Sets up the context for Alex's external conflict - the researchers at his lab care more about being right than finding out the truth.
		Sets up Alex's relationships with his coworkers.

#### Scene 3
Alex goes home and reflects on his external conflict - no longer enjoying research because everyone around him seems to have lost their curiosity. Alex's mom calls. And Dillon visits. Alex looks over Dr. Chen's data and realizes that those outlier data points might be pointing to something greater.
	Purpose:
		Sets up Alex's external conflict.
		Hints at Alex's less than amazing childhood.
		Sets up the main storyline premise.

#### Scene 4
Team meeting with Dr. Chen - Alex is on the team so he's there along with Seraphina. When Alex points out the pattern in the data, he realizes why Dr. Chen's email avoids it - the pattern isn't reproducible, so publishing it basically means publishing fantastical data, which would risk their reputation. Seraphina approaches Alex after the meeting to tell him to meet her after work if he would like to work on this endeavor with her.
	Purpose:
		Showcases the external conflict between Alex and his workplace.
		Reveals a possible resolution through Seraphina.

#### Scene 5
After work, they try to replicate the results of the experiment. As Dr. Chen said, even with the same setup, they couldn't replicate the results. A researcher walks in to grab something and derides them.
	Purpose:
		Sets up an emotional gut response from the researcher's derision.

#### Scene 6
Alex goes home and sees Dillon still working on the motors for his electric skateboard. They talk about what happened that day.
	Purpose:
		Glimpses of Sera's background.

#### Scene 7
Wei confronts Alex about working with Sera. He warns him to watch out for himself - Sera's a highly ambitious researcher who wasn't afraid of throwing people under the bus.
	Purpose:
		Raise the stakes.
		Details into others' impression of Sera.

#### Scene 8
Sera and Alex are at it again trying to reproduce the data. Sera notices Alex's notebook, and they have a discussion about it. Alex confronts her about the incident with the research team she got fired.
	Purpose:
		Delving into Sera's character and Alex's reactions to it.
		Sera's observation of Alex's character - specifically his low self-esteem with regards to his ideas.
		Alex invites her to their weekend game nights, to which she agrees to join.

#### Scene 9
As per tradition, Alex is "forced" to host video gaming tournaments on Saturdays at his studio. Really, it's just for Dillon and his friends and, now, Sera. Dillon insists it's for Alex's own good because otherwise, Alex would just be a loner with nothing other than work to keep him occupied.
	Purpose:
		Sera and Alex meet on more casual terms.

#### Scene 10
On Monday, breakthrough. After pulling an all-nighter setting up the experiment, they finally put it on autopilot. Too early to go straight to work, but too late to go home before work, they settled for drinking coffee in the break room.

#### Scene 11
At work, Sera updated Alex on the success of reproducing the data before proceeding to send out an update email. After work, he heard Dr. Chen yelling at Sera. Unsurprisingly, he had become offended, viewing their effort as a way to show him up. Alex was surprised at Sera's self-control even though it looked as though she was about to tear into him a new one. Instead she leaves the office without a word. Alex hesitates before following her.

Alex had to ask around to figure out where Sera went. It turned out she went to the bar. When he finally came in, he found Sera already on her second drink - a very strong drink. They talk for a bit before Alex offers to walk her home as she was already very drunk.

#### Scene 12
Alex sees Sera's apartment for the first time. Meeting her roommate convinces him to stay to make sure she was okay. As she recovers, she talks.
	Purpose:
		Foreshadows Sera's mental state and background.

#### Scene 13
The next day at work, Wei asks Alex how they were able to reproduce the data, and Alex realizes that while Sera told the lab that they were able to reproduce it, she didn't tell them *how.* He convinces Sera to start a new project - building a time machine - with her as the project lead.

#### Scene 14
Alex puts together the proposal. Dillon wants in on the project. Sera comes over, to their surprise. As expected, the team didn't take it too well.

##### Scene 15
In her typical manner, she is brutal with her critique. However, to her surprise, Alex takes it gracefully. In gratitude, she tells him about her past, offers to help him revise his paper, and tells him that if he ever needed help backing his ideas, she would be willing.
	Purpose:
		Introduces Sera's background.

#### Scene 15
When they finish the paper, before they submit it, Sera tells Alex she isn't sure she wants her name on it. Alex tells her that if that's the case, then they simply won't publish the paper. She is surprised because if they publish, it would've been a breakthrough paper.
	Purpose:
		A crucial connecting moment - neither care for recognition so much as chasing after knowledge.
		The ending cliffhanger - their intention to go on and satisfy their curiosity by trying to create a time machine.
